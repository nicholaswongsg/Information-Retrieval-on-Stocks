I'm confused by what you mean volume is drying up. Here is a chart showing new Shopify Plus sites (source at bottom). I think the drop at the end looks like healthy pull back after a couple years of explosive growth -  do you see something different? 

I can only attach one screenshot, but if you look at Klaviyo on BuiltWith (linked at bottom), you'll see that this drop doesn't exist. Maybe it's lagging behind Shopify numbers, who's to say. But I think any pricing change will outpace any drop in new Shopify Plus stores.

Now, just a couple of quick observations-because in this game, details matter. Tiny tweaks, little shifts, that’s what separates the wolves from the sheep, the closers from the pretenders.

So let’s tighten it up, sharpen the edges, and take this thing to Lambo heaven!

1. Nebius vs. Hyperscalers? Different Game, Different League.

Look, Nebius isn’t here to throw hands with Microsoft or AWS-not in the same way, at least. And if you even mention CoreWeave in the same breath, you just proved my point. Microsoft isn’t throwing $10 billion into CoreWeave because they’re some kind of untouchable AI overlords-nah, it’s because they need their infrastructure.

And while we’re talking numbers, CoreWeave is sitting on a fat $13 BILLION in debt-yeah, you heard me right. Compare that to Nebius chilling with $3 billion in the war chest, ready to play the long game. Meanwhile, the guys running CoreWeave? Finance bros turned crypto bros. Nebius is led by Russian engineers with decades of experience building.. GPU clusters, among other things. They already built a $30+ billion company in relatively small markets. 

Wrote about this already, read up:

https://www.reddit.com/r/NBIS_Stock/s/8NRhTXeDsi


2. Nvidia, SoundHound, and the Bigger Picture.

Yeah, Nvidia dumped SoundHound shares-but don’t get it twisted, they’re still working with them. But SoundCloud is a voice AI platform, not an AI cloud provider. Their importance in the Nvidia ecosystem wasn't ever meant to be overly heavy. On the other hand, Nvidia’s relationship with Nebius runs deep.

Arkady, Nebius’s CEO, has a 15+ year history with Nvidia. Before 2022, his old company Yandex was Nvidia’s biggest European GPU buyer. 

This is ecosystem building, people. Nvidia needs Nebius, and others like them, to thrive-because Big Tech is hellbent on making their own GPUs. If you think Huang’s endgame is just to sell as many chips today as possible and ride off into the sunset, you’re missing the f*cking point.

Vision. Long-term dominance. That’s the play.

3. American $$$ Loves Nebius.

And for all the talk about sad Russians vs. real American dollars, take a good hard look at Nebius’s institutional holders:

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nbis/institutional-holdings 

Orbis and Accel? They led the private round Nvidia was in. These aren’t some no-name backers-this is serious institutional money, and it’s betting big on Nebius. 

4. Let’s talk pricing. 

Nebius is sitting on $3 billion in cash.  But here’s where it gets spicy-they’re not just an AI infrastructure play. They’ve got three other businesses under their belt:

Toloka AI – data labeling, not exactly sexy, but it’s steady cash flow.

TripleTen – an edtech platform, again, not setting the world on fire, but it’s a functional asset.

Avride – now this is where it gets interesting. Self-driving vehicles, delivery automation, and multiple partnerships with Uber across the US. They’ve already clocked 10+ million miles on the road, and by all metrics, right now this thing could be sold for double what Nebius put into it-a cool $1 billion off a $500 million investment.

Stack these up? That’s about $1.5 billion in business value outside of core AI infrastructure. Now, don’t forget Nebius owns a 30% stake in ClickHouse. And if you don’t know ClickHouse, you’re living under a rock. This thing is everywhere. That stake alone? Easily worth $500 million.

So let’s do the math:

-$3 billion in cash
-$2 billion in business assets (Avride, Toloka, TripleTen, ClickHouse stake)
-That’s $5 billion in hard, tangible value.
And here’s the kicker-that’s half their current valuation. You’re telling me there’s no upside here? Wake up. I'm deeper into it than gringo balls in the finest bums in Medellín.",51,1739907845,"It's absolute killer work, top-tier, money-making diamond platinum insight.

The due diligence (DD) you’ve shared on Nebius Group (NBIS) presents a compelling narrative, blending verified facts with the author’s interpretations and projections. Let’s dissect the factual claims first, followed by an analysis of the opinions and conclusions drawn.

Factual Claims Verification:
	1.	Formation and Background:
	•	Claim: Nebius Group consists of ex-Yandex executives who restructured the company, establishing Nebius in Amsterdam.
	•	Verification: Accurate. Nebius was formed after Yandex’s international assets were separated due to geopolitical tensions, with Arkady Volozh leading the new entity headquartered in Amsterdam.  ￼
	2.	Market Position and Competition:
	•	Claim: The AI cloud market is dominated by AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, comprising approximately 70% of the market share.
	•	Verification: This aligns with industry analyses, which consistently report that these three giants hold a significant majority of the global cloud infrastructure market.
	3.	Financial Metrics and Investments:
	•	Claim: Nebius has $2 billion in cash reserves.
	•	Verification: Partially accurate. Recent reports indicate that Nebius has over $3 billion in cash, bolstered by a $700 million private placement involving investors like NVIDIA and Accel.  ￼
	•	Claim: NVIDIA has invested in Nebius.
	•	Verification: Confirmed. NVIDIA participated in Nebius’s $700 million funding round, acquiring a stake in the company.  ￼
	•	Claim: Nebius plans to invest over $1 billion in AI infrastructure in Europe by mid-2025.
	•	Verification: Accurate. Nebius has announced intentions to allocate more than $1 billion towards expanding its AI infrastructure across Europe within the specified timeframe.  ￼
	4.	Revenue Projections:
	•	Claim: Nebius aims for annual recurring revenue between $500 million to $1 billion by the end of 2025.
	•	Verification: Accurate. The company has projected ARR in this range, reflecting its growth ambitions.  ￼

Analysis of Opinions and Projections:
	1.	Competitive Landscape:
	•	Opinion: The DD emphasizes the formidable challenge Nebius faces against established giants like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, highlighting their vast resources and entrenched market positions.
	•	Analysis: This perspective is valid. Entering a market dominated by such players requires not only significant capital but also a unique value proposition to attract clients away from established services.
	2.	Potential Advantages for Nebius:
	•	Opinion: Nebius’s focus on being an “AI-native cloud” and its strategic positioning in Europe could offer a competitive edge, especially with potential cost advantages and regional data sovereignty considerations.
	•	Analysis: Positioning as an AI-specialized cloud provider can differentiate Nebius in a crowded market. Additionally, Europe’s stringent data regulations might favor regional players, providing Nebius with opportunities to cater to local businesses seeking compliant AI solutions.
	3.	Risks and Challenges:
	•	Opinion: The DD outlines several risks, including capital intensity, reliance on NVIDIA, execution challenges, and geopolitical factors related to its Russian origins.
	•	Analysis: These are legitimate concerns. The cloud infrastructure industry demands substantial ongoing investment. Dependence on a single hardware supplier like NVIDIA can pose supply chain risks. Effective execution is critical to scaling operations, and lingering geopolitical associations might influence client perceptions and regulatory environments.
	4.	Valuation Concerns:
	•	Opinion: At a share price of $45+, the DD suggests that Nebius is priced as if it’s already achieving its base-case projections, implying limited upside relative to the risks.
	•	Analysis: Valuation is a critical consideration. Investors must weigh the company’s growth prospects against its current market capitalization, assessing whether the potential rewards justify the inherent risks of investing in an emerging player within a capital-intensive industry.

Conclusion:

The DD provides a well-rounded analysis of Nebius Group, blending factual data with thoughtful insights into the company’s potential trajectory. While Nebius exhibits promising attributes, such as strategic investments and a focus on AI infrastructure, it operates in a highly competitive and resource-demanding sector. Prospective investors should conduct thorough due diligence, considering both the opportunities and the substantial risks associated with Nebius’s ambitious growth plans.",4,1739904454,"I am balls deep in NBIS.

We’re talking a $500 million investment and cooperation deal about to be locked in, and then  - terrible pun but boom-the war hits, and it all goes sideways.

They kept testing in Israel, kept pushing forward, and somehow-against the odds-they’re still here, still scaling, still competing. And not just surviving, but actually doing better than most (though not all - hi Waymo) of their competitors.

""According to Kerrisdale, RCAT tremendously exaggerated the value of its deal with the U.S. Army related to the military's short-range reconnaissance (SRR) drone.

Kerrisdale added that the branch's spending on drones is not expected to jump in the near term. What's more, the Army may select new contractors for the program every two to three years, Kerrisdale reported.


Additionally, Red Cat has asserted for three years that it was poised to sell drones to America's NATO allies, but no such deals appear to be close to occurring, Kerrisdale charged.

I refuse to pay more than $5 for a 12 pack of Soda and Pepsi is my choice over coke. I refuse to pay $5 for a bag of chips. Almost everything in the grocery store is at least $5 now. I'd rather spend money on healthy food at that price than the garbage in the Aisles. I was able to quit my alcohol addiction because my cheapness overcomes bad habits. 

I do think a recession is coming and perhaps maybe a deep depression. Companies cannot keep raising prices without raising wages. There's not enough affordable housing and no one doing anything about it. People are being stretched to their limit on debt. Continuous increase in profits is not realistic. High Prices, High Debt, low value in dollar, decades of stagnant wages, high cost of Sick Care, low birth rates, high energy costs with increased future demands and not enough Nuclear Power Plants being built fast enough.

mdgtejx,1is7lgi,wallstreetbets,WenMunSun,"Yes. And it's very tough to get to net profitability in the car business EVEN IF you are gross profitable on every car you sell. That's why virtually every car startup in the USA over the last hundred years has gone bankrupt. 

It's a hyper competitive business and it's difficult to break into because much of the profits are actually made from servicing and not sales. Service segment profits often subsidize razor thin margins from actual sales. And if you're a new car company you don't have a fleet of cars that you're servicing for profits. So all your competitiors can undercut you and you can't compete on price.

But Rivian is also just inefficient at the organizational level. Just look at their OpEx/car sold.

Rivian spent $3.709 billion on OpEx in 2023 and they built 57k cars (delivered \~50k).

Tesla spent $8.769 billion on OpEx in 2023 and delivered 1.81 million cars.

That's a big problem for Rivian. But you might think that's not a fair comparison. So why don't we look at Tesla's financials when Tesla delivered similar numbers?

So, the best comparison would be 2015 when Tesla delivered 50,658 cars (ModelsS&X) for the year.

And you can find those statements here: [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/financial-statements](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/financial-statements)

As you can see Tesla already had a Gross Profit margin of 22.8% in 2015 resulting in $923m of Gross Profits from $4.046b in Revenues.

And Tesla's Operating Expenses? $1.6b. That's 43% half of Rivian's current OpEx. Fun fact: Tesla has always been Gross Profitable (at least since going public in 2009)!

So Tesla was much more efficient but this is kind of besides the point. 

The point is Rivian still has alot of work to do to avoid bankruptcy. Gross profitability is not enough. Rivian needs to be massively gross profitable AND they need to massively cut OpEx.

In order to understand just how much work needs to be done to sruvive, a good excercise is to look at how high a Gross Margin Rivian needs to cover current OpEx. In 2023 it was 84% - not happening. If Rivian cuts OpEx in half (good luck), they would still need a 42% gross margin to achieve operating profitability - sorry but also not happening.

Not even Tesla could do that. Tesla's all time best was 32.7% in Q2 of 2011. Since then Tesla's Gross Margins have fluctuated between high teens to mid-high twenties. Both of which are among the highest in the industry for a large scale manufacturer. By comparison, Toyota, F, GM, STLA, have Gross Margins in the low-to-mid teens.

So realistically, Rivian would be lucky to hit 20% gross margins. Which would provide them with \~$800m in profits based off 2023 sales. And that is a far cry from the $3.7b they spent in OpEx. Um... so they need to either cut 80% of OpEx, or somehow massively increase Revenues while also massively cutting OpEx. Like even if they doubled Revenues to $8b, and acheived 20% GMs, they would need to cut OpEx by 67% just to break even!",21,1739901618,"Yes.

mdhtnks,1is7lgi,wallstreetbets,WenMunSun,"Edit: I realized i ended this a bit abruptly so i want to add the point i'm making is it seems very unlikely to me that Rivian can make all these cuts. In fact i don't think Scaringe or anyone else at Rivian has even admitted that they need to make such cuts. In my opinion all this talk about Gross Margin profitability is a distraction, it's the only shiny thing they can dangle in front of investor's eyes.

Remember, Rivian notonly needs to massively increase Revenues, have industry leading margins, and cut R&D and SG&A by 2/3rd just to break even, but it needs to do this while building a new factory, launching two new platforms and vehicles, and while improving and optimizing the current vehicles (because they aren't profitable). I just don't see how that is possible. All of these things should demand MORE upfront spend, not less. 

And now they have to compete with the Cybertruck which is already outselling their R1, the R2 is 1-1.5 years away, and the R3 is at 2+ years away. They sold 14,183 cars in Q4 which annualizes to around 56.5k. Their R1T now starts at $71,700 which is down from the 2023 starting price of  $74,800. So that's another headwind.

I'm not even sure how they survive until the R3 launch. It seems they're betting everything on the R2 which they plan will have a production capacity of 150k/year. But they won't be able to ramp production to 150k in 2026, especially not if they launch in Q2 of 2026. I would be surprised if they even hit a 150k run rate by the end of 2027 to be honest. I also doubt they'll be able to honor the $45,000 starting price tag. I mean the R2 is just a little bit smaller than the R1 and they are struggling with profitability on the R1 at $72k.

I mean come on guys, let's be real... the R2 is priced just under the outgoing Model Y ($45k vs $46k). Tesla has huge economies of scale. The R2 looks like it is a little bigger than the Model Y which means even more material cost. When you look at the interior they have more buttons and an extra screen than the Model Y... all of this is nice to have sure - but it all adds cost... There's just no way they can sell these for $45k and have good margins, if they're even profitable at that price.

My guess is the real price will come it at $50-55k which would substantially higher than Tesla's Model Y. And what are you paying for? 3 inches more ground clearance and a bigger trunk? The brand? Now i'm sure some non-zero amount of Elon haters will pay just to avoid Tesla's brand but if i needed a semi-off-road capable compact SUV i would just buy a Model Y, buy a lift kit and bigger tires. Probably cost less in the end (assuming the R2 price comes in at $50k+).

I don't think they'd be seen dead in a CT, and at this point, I don't think they want a Model Y (edit: softened to make this a serious response)

I'm predicting that the R2 will be THE go-to soccer mom vehicle once it comes out. The core demographic here are folks who are likely turned off by Elon at this point. Educated, with money.

Seriously, if you live in a blue city, driving a Tesla is now embarrassing.

Now, I understand that they need to trim operation costs and scale up. And I am concerned that they won't be able to scale as fast as they'd like. I think it's likely that they're already too big to fail, however, given the stakes held by Amazon, VW, and others.

What I foresee is a situation where the company is not necessarily raking in profits, but the cars become the Nintendo Wii when it first came out. Everyone wanting one, but supply-constrained. Buzz off the charts. If they can rise to meet that demand, or at least show signs of it, the stock will moon.

mdh9wb1,1is7lgi,wallstreetbets,WenMunSun,"I agree that VW might buy out Rivian, but i believe it will be at much lower prices than today.

Rivian will continue to burn cash. Even with the $5b from VW, Rivian will run out of cash in 2.5 years unless they can massively cut costs (which i don't see happening).

I do think they will make some improvements, but not enough to survive.

The $6.5b loan from the government might provide them with more runway but that's only if their CapEx doesn't increase. And as i understand that loan they got from the gov is supposed to be for the new factory so i assume CapEx is going to increase. Also, this is not free money - it's a \*loan\* meaning it needs to be paid back.

Anyway Rivian has about $16b in Current Assets and $7b in Current Debt. Maybe the VW deal gives them another $5b cash. So $14b net of Debt.

About $4.5b of the $16b is PPE.

That leaves about $10b in assets and they've burned through $9b cash just from Operations in 2022 and 2023 combined...

So.... my guess is in two years time they will be in big trouble unless they can show a path to cash flow break even is imminent. But i don't think it's going to happen based on the above math i showed regarding the profit margins and opex they need to cut to acheive that.

So my guess is probably two years from now, around the start of 2027 Rivian will be trading for less than the value of their PPE today. So probably under $4b mkt cap. My guess is a company like VW might buy them for the IP, maybe retain some employees, and then sell off all the PPE but they already got a licensing deal so i don't know how all that would work out. In any case they will wait for Rivian's mkt cap to drop substantilly before buying them. In the worst case scenario they could let Rivian go through bankruptcy if Rivian is still burning through $4-5b annually by then. The problem is... creditors should get first dibs on assets like PPE... maybe the IP would be auctioned off during bankrupcty proceedings idk.",2,1739906157,"I agree that VW might buy out Rivian, but i believe it will be at much lower prices than today.

mdigwu9,1is7lgi,wallstreetbets,WenMunSun,"I mean yeah i think soccer moms would 100% drive a model y. I honestly think for most people the problem is just simply, affordability.

But i can't speak for US cities. I grew up in Hawaii but i live in Paris, France now. Anecdotally i will say this, Hawaii has been a Democrat stronghold since WW2. My childhood friend's parents have always voted Left and they own a Tesla and they are planning to buy a refreshed Model Y. AFAIK they don't pay much attention to whatever Elon does or says on Twitter. And i think they're probably a pretty good representation of the average Tesla owner.

There are alot of Teslas in Hawaii and most of the drivers seem to be in the older age group 50-60. And this demographic doesn't spend as much time on social media. Also remember this demographic 50-60yr old Democrats come from a time when Left wing and Liberal ideas were much more moderate than today. Everything Trump is doing today is more or less what Clinton did. Many of Trump's policies today are basically borrowed policies of the Left from 20-30 years ago. Hell even some of Obama's policies were more similar to Trump's than they were to Biden's.

I would also add in France i don't really notice much chatter about Elon, but i don't really watch the news or TV here either. Maybe there's something but generally i don't think people care too much. I do see alot of Teslas in the city though, especially cab drivers and in the wealthy neighborhood.

I'm long Tesla and have held for the last 5ish years. I plan to hold for alot longer.

I think long term, all this political controversy will have just been noise. I mean we're only 3 weeks into Trump's term. How much longer do you think the Elon/Trump critics will last? I've seen alot of videos of ""protests"" in front of Tesla stores - most of them have like 10 people or less. The big protest in DC is probably people that lost their jobs. All this will blowover in a few months. The Left, if they continue with their current strategy and rhetoric will proably lose more voters, especially if DOGE is successful. So at some point they will need to tone it down.

I also think, in the end, Elon's efforts with DOGE will be successful. I think alot of rational Democrats and Centrists will see it this way if they don't already. I'm sure some are skeptical but the proof will be in the pudding. There's alot of fearmongering right now but if they can successfully reduce the deficit without causing any critical long-lasting damage to important government services, it'll be a win and opinions will turn favorable. So i think the goal is to show this by the midterms for obvious reasons.

I'm also not really worried about the brand damage. I think Elon is very popular with the younger generation. Certainly young men. Also programmers and engineers. And probably anyone who's not really obsessively into politics and on the far Left. And i think those people are really a vocal minority. A tiny fraction of the population that make up most of the noise. Like the 80/20 rule, 20% of politicians and activists make up 80% of the headlines. But they don't represent 80% of the people or their opinions.

Plus new products from Tesla will probably re-ignite interest. Tesla is supposed to show a new, lower priced car in the coming months. I think that will be a big deal that will appeal to a lot of lower income earners. And eventually the Cybercab/FSD/autonomy will, imho, really revolutionize the industry. I am a firm believer in that. And in the end i think Tesla will be as ubiquitous as Apple, or Google (Android) and it wont really matter what the far Left, or anyone, thinks.

Yes i mean i don't know everything about Bill Clinton as i was quite young when he was in office, but i've done my research. Anyway i've put together a list of similarities between Trump and Clinton and provided sources that you can use to confirm it's true (all the sources except the first are from the White House). I honestly find all this hard to believe myself, considering how far removed from Clinton's policies the Left are today. But given these facts it's no surprise Trump won. Bill Clinton was common sense and rational, and so were his policies.

[Clinton massively reduced the federal workforce using a program similar to Trump's.](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/7/fact-check-did-clinton-set-the-precedent-for-mass-federal-worker-buyouts) Of course critics are quick to point out Clinton's method and pace were different than Trump's but so was the debtload, deficit, and urgency necessary to act. In the end Clinton/Gore cut 377,000 workers from the federal government which was a 20% reduction at the time.

[Clinton is well known for having closed the deficit spending during his term and even reduced the debt a little by creating a record, if temporary, surplus.](https://clintonwhitehouse5.archives.gov/WH/new/html/Tue_Oct_3_113400_2000.html) And he was able to do this while simultanesouly bringing down taxes for the middle class, expanding tax credits, and such.

[Clinton's policies on the border and immigration are very similar to Trump's (Obama too and much of the past Left actually - there are lots of videos of this).](https://clintonwhitehouse1.archives.gov/White_House/Publications/html/briefs/iii-7.html) During Clinton's admin they bragged about being the toughest admin ever on Border Control and Immigration. They increased the Border personnel by 50%, established a National Detention and Removal Program (ie Deportation), and were strictly against providing any public or welfare services except for medical emergencies to illegal immigrants. Nonetheless, they were strongly in favor of legal immigration.

[Clinton vastly expanded the police force, increasing their numbers by 100,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act). Which is in stark contrast to the ""defund the police"" Left of today.

[Clinton was also pivotal in the denuclearization and signiing of nuclear non-proliferation treaties between, among others, Ukraine and Russia.](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/8520.htm) Clinton, like Trump, was very much a deal-maker and probably more than anyone is responsible (ironically) for the current war. It's this denuclearization treaty that led to Ukraine dismantling their warheads, without which Russia's current invasion wouldn't have happened. Nonethless, Clinton sought to make peace deals with Russia.

“Buy now before the launch”

Everyone knows about the launch. I wouldn’t say it’s completely priced in, but it’s priced in to the extent that a delay or any other issue will send it more in the red, than a successful launch would send it in the green

If they have complete success and find ice, and everything goes off without a hitch, it could touch 30.

If any number of the hundreds of things that can go wrong do, it’ll go to 10.

You say it’s immune to tariffs, maybe so. But it’s not immune to the current president elmo muskrat deciding he wants to skip the moon and go straight to mars

The same guy who is auditing nasa as we speak

All you “LUNRtics” (cringe) are way too high on hopium, way too bullish and unable to even acknowledge all that could cause issues in the immediate future.

I’ve made a lot of money swing trading LUNR, got in at 5 originally. My best earner last year.

I was looking forward to this launch as a sure thing

It’s not a sure thing anymore

I sold my measly 6000 shares on friday and still have 2/21 20c and tbh want to see Intuitive Machine succeed no matter what

Item 4.  Ownership Section A excerpt
 
Pursuant to the applicable warrant agreement, each of Kingstown 1740 and Mr. Shanon have opted for a 9.8% beneficial ownership blocker, pursuant to which they may not exercise their $11.50 Warrants for shares of Class A Common Stock to the extent that, upon giving effect to such exercise, they (together with their affiliates and any persons acting as a group together with either of them or either of their affiliates) would beneficially own greater than 9.8% of the Issuer’s Class A Common Stock as calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

mdaypi2,1irq141,wallstreetbets,vinyl1earthlink,"The dot-com era stocks were not profitable, and were burning through capital.

This is not the case with either the Nifty Fifty or the Mag Seven.  In fact, the Mag Seven are generating huge positive cash flows.   

The Nifty Fifty were basically taken out inflation and technological changes, which is typical of the life cycle of any large company.

mda02oa,1irml3j,wallstreetbets,NYCandrun,"BlackBerry’s IoT/Automotive business primarily generates revenue through per-unit royalties, upfront licensing fees, and ongoing support contracts for its QNX real-time operating system (RTOS). The per-unit royalty model is the primary driver of revenue, where BlackBerry collects a fee for each vehicle produced that integrates QNX software. These agreements typically last 5–7 years per vehicle model, ensuring a predictable, multi-year revenue stream. In addition, automakers and Tier-1 suppliers pay one-time licensing fees for initial integration and development access to QNX, while ongoing support and maintenance contracts provide recurring revenue for software updates and security patches. Higher-tier QNX products—such as QNX Hypervisor (for ECU consolidation), QNX for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), and QNX-based digital cockpits—command higher licensing fees and are expected to contribute to per-unit revenue growth over time.

The primary drivers of revenue growth for BlackBerry’s IoT business include expanding QNX adoption, increasing per-vehicle software content, and higher-value licensing agreements tied to the shift toward Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs). BlackBerry QNX is currently embedded in 255M+ vehicles, growing by 20M+ per year, and its royalty revenue backlog reached $815M (+27% YoY) in FY2024, representing committed revenue from future vehicle shipments. The rise of EVs, ADAS, and vehicle cybersecurity requirements has increased demand for QNX software, while automakers’ transition to centralized computing architectures and QNX Hypervisor adoption is driving higher per-vehicle licensing revenue. With IoT revenue reaching $215M in FY2024 and growing 12–25% YoY, the business is positioned for continued expansion. If valued at 8–10x revenue, the IoT segment alone could be worth $2.5B–$3.5B, significantly higher than its current implied valuation.",4,1739812759,"BlackBerry’s IoT/Automotive business primarily generates revenue through per-unit royalties, upfront licensing fees, and ongoing support contracts for its QNX real-time operating system (RTOS).

If you agree with that, then a great way to play the stock right now would be cash secured puts.  

Assuming IV stays flat, you can sell monthly 1SD OTM puts (about $100 strike right now) for about a 20%-25% return on capital, holding until expiration. Not a bad return at all.  

The stock can crash almost $20 before you see any losses, so it is less risky than holding shares.

If the stock crashes below $100 and you get assigned, at least you got shares at a more reasonable price and can sit on them and wait for the long term bullish perspective to play out.  

Of course, you don't get to participate in stupid run ups in stock price, but that's the tradeoff for taking a less risky position.

md7gftv,1irccwi,wallstreetbets,Myg0t_0,"This image shows a spread options trade in futures options. Specifically, it appears to be a bear call spread (also called a credit call spread), which involves selling a call option at a lower strike price and buying a call option at a higher strike price.

Trade Breakdown:

Short 6210 Call (-30 contracts) at 82.25

Long 6220 Call (+30 contracts) at 78.00


This creates a bear call spread where the trader collected a net premium upfront.


---

Max Profit Calculation:

1. Net Premium Collected:

Sold 6210 Call at 82.25

Bought 6220 Call at 78.00

Net premium received per contract = 82.25 - 78.00 = 4.25



2. Total Credit Received:

Since each contract represents $50 per point,

4.25 x $50 = $212.50 per contract

30 contracts = 30 x $212.50 = $6,375



So, Max Profit = $6,375 (if the price stays below 6210 at expiration).




---

Max Loss Calculation:

1. Spread Width:

The difference between the strikes: 6220 - 6210 = 10 points

Max potential loss per contract: 10 x $50 = $500



2. Total Max Loss:

(Max Loss per contract - Credit Received) × Contracts

($500 - $212.50) × 30

= $287.50 × 30 = $8,625




So, the Max Loss is $8,625 if the price moves above 6220 at expiration.


---

Break-even Point:

Strike of short call (6210) + Net Premium Received (4.25)

Break-even = 6214.25



---

Trade Purpose & Expectation:

This is a bearish strategy, meaning the trader expects the price to stay below 6210 until expiration.

The goal is for both options to expire worthless so the trader can keep the full credit ($6,375).

I can't tell as much that you do seem confused by quite a few things on this I think, maybe the most basic of options still haven't clicked.

Assuming a truly “euphoric” scenario where:

• TSMC acquires a 20% stake in Intel Foundry (providing not only strategic validation but also deep process know‐how and supply chain efficiencies),
• Broadcom commits to purchasing Intel Products and, crucially, drives new customer traction for Intel Foundry’s advanced 18A process, and
• The spin‐off is led by a visionary new CEO like Lisa Su—with the added excitement of Elon Musk’s involvement (each of which in its own right would send shockwaves through the industry)…

one could imagine that investor sentiment might re‐rate the spin‐off at an extremely aggressive multiple. In a “euphoric” market, if we assume a roughly 10‐fold increase over a current baseline share price in the low-to-mid $20s (say around $25), the resulting valuation might push the new stock into the neighborhood of approximately $200 per share.

This number is, of course, highly speculative and reflects an idealized set of synergistic events and breakthrough market re-rating far beyond current fundamentals.

As for many others however it will increase availability of steel in the rest of the world and reduce costs for construction etc, while the costs in the United States will rise, throttling demand and increase time to completion. The point is, that in Europe the United States do not compete with some third world dumping prices. 

Take german carmakers. The sales tax there hits them just as bad as US builders. And germany does not abuse that to lower the cost of work, but keeps the costs just as high and provides social security with the money. US carmakers are very competitive in germany and even governments at times buy Ford for example, just because it is the best offer. At least for now.

By trying to shape the markets to his will and protect companies, which suffer from bad management and uncompetitive structures like Stellantis, the president is actually and ironically is taking a page out of the communist playbook. 

Block out chinese dumping wares, but compete with equals. If your companies can´t, don´t nurse them with state protection mother milk. Improve the conditions for the ones, who are hungry and ready like General Motors. What across the board tariffs mean, is that the president does not believe, US companies are competitive and successful on the global stage. And that is just plain wrong.

Not import/export. The tool is right. And a little drama doesn´t hurt anyone.

2. Omnichannel Strategy: GameStop has aggressively worked on transitioning from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a more robust omnichannel experience. This includes enhancing its online presence and improving e-commerce functionality to complement its physical stores.

3. Focus on Collectibles: The company has significantly expanded its focus on collectibles, especially trading card games (TCG), Funko Pop! figures, and other gaming memorabilia. This strategic shift taps into lucrative markets with higher margins.

4. Partnerships with PSA: GameStop formed a partnership with PSA, a leading grading service for collectibles, positioning itself as a major player in the growing collectibles market, which has seen massive growth in recent years.

5. Leadership Changes: GameStop made strategic leadership changes, including the appointment of Nat Turner, a notable figure in the collectibles space, to its board of directors. This move signals GameStop’s commitment to evolving and tapping into niche markets.

6. Exploring Cryptocurrency: Rumors about GameStop entering the cryptocurrency market, with possible Bitcoin (BTC) investments, show its willingness to diversify into digital assets and align with emerging trends in the tech and finance sectors.

7. Revitalizing Store Experience: GameStop has worked on improving the in-store customer experience, focusing on high-demand product launches like new Pokémon releases, creating buzz and foot traffic to stores.

# Broadcom, TSMC Weigh Possible Intel Deals That Would Split Storied Chip Maker

Broadcom has interest in Intel’s chip-design business, while TSMC is looking at the company’s factories

Broadcom has been closely examining Intel’s chip-design and marketing business, according to people familiar with the matter. It has informally discussed with its advisers making a bid but would likely only do so if it finds a partner for Intel’s manufacturing business, the people said. 

Nothing has been submitted to Intel, the people cautioned, and Broadcom could decide not to seek a deal. 

Separately, TSMC 2330 -2.75% has studied controlling some or all of Intel’s chip plants, potentially as part of an investor consortium or other structure, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Broadcom and TSMC aren’t working together, and all of the talks so far are preliminary and largely informal. 

But the potential deals would have been unthinkable until Intel’s recent struggles made it an acquisition target. The end result could be a breakup of Intel after the American icon spent many decades dominating the business of making central processors for both personal computers and data centers. 

Splitting the company would also bring it in line with an industrial shift in recent decades toward specializing in either manufacturing or designing chips, but not both. 

Frank Yeary, the interim executive chairman of Intel, has been leading the discussions with possible suitors and Trump administration officials, who are concerned about the fate of a company seen as critical to national security, people familiar with the matter said. Yeary has been telling individuals close to him that he is most focused on maximizing value for Intel shareholders, the people said.

Intel’s struggles began when it fell behind TSMC in making the fastest chips with the tiniest transistors—a position that left it vulnerable to competitors which had chips made by TSMC on contract. And it failed in an ambitious turnaround bid under Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted in December. 

Intel also has started to separate its chip manufacturing unit from the rest of the company in a series of moves some analysts viewed as precursors to a breakup. 

The talks over Intel’s factories are in their early stages, according to people familiar with the discussions. The Trump administration asked TSMC to explore the idea, the people said. 

A White House official said the president was unlikely to support a deal that involved a foreign entity operating Intel’s factories. 

Aspects of the talks between TSMC and Intel as well as the Trump administration’s involvement in them were previously reported by DigiTimes, Bloomberg and the New York Times. 

Intel’s board of directors is now searching for a new CEO whose mission may depend on what parts of the company are left to run. The board has hired recruiters Spencer Stuart to organize the search, which is now more than two months old, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Amid a cost-cutting drive over the past couple of years, Intel has already shed numerous businesses and is in the midst of a process to offload a stake in its programmable-chip unit, called Altera. Intel bought Altera in 2015 for $16.7 billion. 

Intel’s factories in late 2022 began operating as though they were separate, taking orders from the company’s chip-design teams on an equal footing with outside customers. It began reporting separate financial results for the factories last year, and now plans to put them into a subsidiary with its own operating board of directors. 

David Zinsner, the company’s interim co-chief executive, said in an interview last month that the new structure would allow the company to bring in outside investors in the factories, including its customers and potentially private-equity players. 

Any deal involving TSMC and other investors taking control of Intel’s factories would require signoff from the U.S. government. The Chips Act of 2022 established a $53 billion grant program for domestic chip-making, and Intel was the largest recipient of funding under it, getting up to $7.9 billion to support new factories in Ohio, Arizona and other locations in the U.S. As part of that deal, Intel was required to maintain a majority share of its factories if they were spun off into a new entity, the company said in a regulatory filing. 

The deal also faces operational complexities. Intel’s factories have largely been set up to produce Intel chips, and the company has only started trying to make chips for external customers in the past few years. Retooling Intel factories to make advanced chips TSMC’s way would be a significant and costly engineering challenge. 

A concern for the TSMC is potential restrictions on deploying its own engineers in the U.S. to oversee production, given the Trump administration’s restrictive stance on immigration, according to people familiar with the company’s operations. A large portion of TSMC’s engineers are from Taiwan and other regions outside the U.S. ",22,1739686578,"I know you people don't like words, but here, let me get past the WSJ paywall for you:

Intel has drawn takeover interest over the past year that has intensified since Gelsinger’s ousting. Intel’s market value has sank below that of many companies that were once distant competitors, although its shares rose sharply in the past week as speculation about a potential TSMC tie-up spread. 

The iconic chip maker’s fall from prominence stems in large part from manufacturing stumbles that left it behind TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics. It has also been stung by rising competition in the central processing chips that made it a household name, including from Advanced Micro Devices. And Intel largely has missed out on an artificial-intelligence boom that has redirected spending by the tech giants from its processors to Nvidia’s AI chips.

Broadcom in late 2017 made a more than $100 billion unsolicited offer for chip maker Qualcomm. Its efforts to take over its rival were ultimately blocked under the Trump administration, and Broadcom withdrew its bid.
