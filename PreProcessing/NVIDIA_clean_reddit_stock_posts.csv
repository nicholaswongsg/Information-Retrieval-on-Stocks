1izpb9q,NVDA_Stock,Dan Nathan and Gene Munster delve into the disappointing near-term guidance for Nvidia.,"[https://youtu.be/tzU\_UQIurtc?si=Q5wGVti99TYP2Gzj](https://youtu.be/tzU_UQIurtc?si=Q5wGVti99TYP2Gzj)

Dan Nathan and Gene Munster delve into the disappointing near-term guidance for Nvidia.

This was recorded early this morning right after the market opened. Gene Munster says early on that he would expect a 5% drop today. 

Gene cites that in the context of NVDA having an extremely high bar to overcome, this report ranged from mixed to disappointing. The drop in margin to 71% surprised Gene. 

The guidance came with a one year outlook, which relies heavily on the back half of the year, with the ramp up to Blackwell in the October-January quarter. 

The most important question for most is “how long will Blackwell be sold out?” which Gene felt they were radio silent on.

Dan cites how NVDA has made no progress since June, the last couple quarters have been flat. Long term, they are both very bullish on NVDA, but short term, for 2025, Dan is skeptical about seeing a resurgence on margins in the back half of the year. 

This is the first time in 8 quarters, where the big firms are not raising their outlooks meaningfully. But he thinks NVDA’s current price range is between $105-150. 

Both agree if 2025 is largely a throwaway year, then there is no reason to expect a big rally or big direction push to higher highs. One thing that can change that and make the stock go higher this year is how investors anticipate 2026 and look for any data points about how much more or less compute is needed. Then you'll see investors get more aggressive on owning NVDA ahead of 2026.

1iz782e,NVDA_Stock,This was the start...,"I've been listening and hearing about the ""start of the AI bubble popping"" for the last...12 months, 18 months.

Constantly, people belaboring and bemoaning how this was unsustainable, the Bubble is going to pop.

THIS earnings, ALL the headwinds Nvidia faced, Blackwell delayed, yield issues, lower margins(still insanely good margins) and they STILL got through all of that, not unscathed, they've taken some hits, but this is the start of the next run for NVDA. The next Chapter.

Guiding for 43 Billion, Jensen on CNBC talking about how they will go straight into Blackwell Ultra the second half of Fiscal '26. For everyone that held, it may not payoff big right away, -though, other than tariffs and general macro sentiment, I don't understand why it wouldn't pop 10%, but they're setting up for a MONSTER 1st Quarter, Fiscal 2026.

Nvidia is going to have more net revenue than AAPL, Googl, META, MSFT. They're going to be the first to 4T. I don't know if they it 5T this year, but I've held this stock the last 9 months waiting for an Earnings like this(I've held it a lot longer than 9 months, but, the last 9 months, THIS was EXACTLY what I wanted to hear).

So take green or red tomorrow, if you're in this for the next year(at least)...you're going to do well. 200 EOY(Fiscal).

  
Edit-

Shit happens. I can't predict the shit that's going to come out of tariffs and what happens with the market, but I'm not selling a share of NVDA. Every year people will say, ""yeah but the real question is will this demand extend into next year."" 3 years in a row we've heard it. It's not slowing, it's growing.

1iz3zqd,NVDA_Stock,"[UPDATE] NVDA Q4 FY 2025 Earnings, Revenue, and Guidance —Actuals and Discussion","Last week I wrote a post about how NVDA would post $40.XX billion in revenue this quarter. They did not. I also made some other predictions that varied in success. I have included a table that shows the Q4 Actuals against my estimates and the magnitude of the beat/miss in % terms. 

[\*Note “Beats” are negative when calculating expenses and positive when calculating income\*](https://preview.redd.it/o2k5b6hf2lle1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=7252300e69d8b68a988769941abd7c400c454d7a)

Given my expectations, my main takeaway from the report is that NVDA is operating vastly more efficiently than expected. NVDA reported operating expenses 20% below their company-issued guidance, while my estimate for Non-operating expenses was almost 10% too high. So, while revenue came in light, Net Income exceeded my expectations even while repurchasing fewer shares. This resulted in NVDA beating my EPS expectation by $0.01. NVDA guidance exceeded my expectations ($43B vs $42B). 

As an investor, I think this is a monster report. $40B was already aggressive, they didn't hit it, and still, their profit was higher than I anticipated projecting $40B in revenue. 

The stock is relatively flat as of the time of writing this, and given this report I feel confident as ever as an investor. Reading some headlines, the only negative point I can see is about slowing YoY growth. Considering no one is expecting NVDA to continue to grow tripe digit percent YoY, it suggests there is not much to complain about.

* Lower Revenue even lower costs.

250226_1Q25 IT Key takeaways from Taiwan / Korea Conference - JPMorgan

(1) NVDA Supply Chain in Better Shape with GB200 Ramping Up:
• According to a check of NVIDIA’s supply chain channels, the GB200 ramp-up has improved over the past month, with increased yields in areas such as server ODMs and liquid cooling.
• Notably, Hon Hai mentioned a shipment of 30K–50K NVL72 units industry-wide in ’25, and the industry expects the B300 to be launched by mid-’25.
• AI GPU demand has also grown stronger following DeepSeek, with increased demand for not only the H100 but also some for the H20 (with H20 not being reflected upstream).
• NVIDIA is accelerating efforts to launch Rubin by mid-’26 and is continuously monitoring the possibility of adopting CPO in ’27.
• In the short term, given the positive outlook for GB200 in Q1 ’25 and the sustained strength in AI infrastructure demand, momentum is expected to build ahead of GTC.

(2) GPU vs ASIC Debate Continues; But Need to Be Selective on ASICs:
• Within the ASIC supply chain, companies have shown a positive stance regarding the AWS Trn2 ramp-up in 1H ’25, while the growth momentum for GCP TPU appears relatively subdued.
• Alchip is likely to secure orders for a 3nm ASIC project, which is expected to significantly contribute to its overall performance in ’26.
• Mediatek’s AI ASIC project is progressing smoothly, with production expected to expand from ’26 and the possibility of acquiring new customers in ’27.
• Although the adoption of ASICs is on the rise, there still aren’t many projects providing suppliers with meaningful volumes, necessitating a selective approach to the ASIC theme.

(3) CPO Adoption Starting in 2026; Largely Led by TSMC:
• Full-scale adoption of CPO is expected to begin in ’26, with TSMC leading this segment.
• The initial application will likely be in CPO switches (with NVDA and AVGO as strong candidates), followed by interposer-based CPO for AI XPU, which is expected to materialize only in ’27.
• Currently, the CPO supply chain is predominantly formed around TSMC, as its role is paramount in interposer-based CPO.
• The introduction of CPO will boost demand for advanced packaging and positively impact companies involved in CoWoS, Hybrid Bonding, Photonics IC Foundries, Fiber Array Units, and Waveguides.
• Present bottlenecks for CPO include challenges in 1) thermal management and 2) integrating photonics and electronic ICs into a single package.

(4) CoWoS Food Chain – All Eyes on Apple, Panel-Level, and SoIC:
• The CoWoS equipment supply chain is currently in a holding pattern because TSMC/OSAT do not have any immediate CAPA expansion plans.
• There is potential for Apple to adopt the CoW (Chip-on-Wafer) process: if iPhone packaging replaces the current InFO (Integrated Fan-Out) process with CoW, it would be favorable—with adoption likely in 2H ’26, although some uncertainties remain in the equipment supply chain.
• Expansion of Panel-level Fan-Out (PLFO) is anticipated: most suppliers expect higher tool density and lower ASP at the panel level compared to CoWoS. A full-scale expansion is expected from 2H ’25, with mass production starting in ’27.
• The success of SOIC (System on Integrated Chips) is still uncertain. Although Apple is expected to be the catalyst, customers remain concerned about process yields.
• In summary, the key factors shaping the future of the CoWoS supply chain will be Apple’s process choices, the pace of panel-level packaging expansion, and SOIC yield performance.

(5) HBM Growth Outlook Strong into 2026; Commodity DRAM Cycle Could Trough Earlier:
• Both SKH and SEC forecast strong HBM demand over the coming years, driven by robust CAPEX from U.S. hyperscalers.
• Following DeepSeek, the downward pricing trend in AI inference/reasoning is favorably impacting the HBM industry, with continuous acceleration in AI use cases and ecosystem development.
• SKH anticipates that the HBM supply shortage will persist until ’26, and as the market transitions to HBM3E 12hi/HBM4, ASPs are expected to rise.
• Moreover, from HBM4/4E onward, standardization is unlikely, leading to an increased demand for customization.
• For commodity DRAM, both SKH and SEC expect a modest improvement in market conditions from 2H ’25, driven by 1) increased Edge AI and 2) a volume transition from D4 to D5.

(6) Smartphone – Edge AI Hopes Are High; Need More Evidence to Substantiate Unit Upside:
• The trend toward smartphone specification upgrades and premiumization continues, and while expectations for Edge AI are high, tangible increases in demand remain to be verified.
• There is insufficient evidence to strongly support the idea that Edge AI will shorten the smartphone replacement cycle.
• Apple’s performance in ’25 might remain somewhat stagnant without significant changes, but growth recovery is expected in ’26 with the introduction of new form factors (e.g., a foldable iPhone).

(7) 2Q Caution in Consumer Electronics After Strong 1Q Pull-In:
• Several fabless companies experienced strong pull-in in 1Q ’25 due to potential Chinese subsidies and tariff impositions, but they warn of a potential slowdown in growth in 2Q ’25 (as evidenced by Realtek’s downward guidance and recent cuts by Unimicron noted by JPMorgan).
• Although investor expectations have already been lowered, the anticipated slowdown in demand during 2Q ’25 is a negative factor for the Taiwanese fabless industry.
• However, Novatek and ASMedia are expected to maintain relatively positive momentum in 2Q ’25 due to new product cycles and market share expansion.

(8) Resilient PCs in 1H25, with Strengthening Gaming Tailwinds:
• Laptop ODMs and PC semiconductor suppliers forecast strong demand in 1H ’25, exceeding seasonal averages.
• Despite the impact of tariff-avoidance pre-orders in 4Q ’24, Q1 ’25 is expected to show robust growth driven by inventory build-up ahead of new product launches. However, the growth rate for PC components may slightly decelerate due to the pre-order effect.
• While commercial PC demand has not yet recovered, gaming PC demand is rebounding strongly with the launch of the RTX50 series, and the overall PC TAM is projected to grow by +MSD this year.

(9) Cyclical Tech Demand Not Showing Any Signs of Improvement:
• Although companies such as ADI and IFX have seen a slight rebound, overall recovery signals in cyclical tech demand remain absent.
• Inventory levels in the automotive and industrial sectors continue to be high, with most foundries and OSATs operating at 60–70% capacity.
• Even though inventory levels in the consumer electronics sector are low, sustained recovery in end demand following the 1Q ’25 pre-orders is critical.
• Recovery in the automotive and industrial sectors is expected to start as early as 2H ’25, with wafer raw material suppliers commenting that ’25 might be a no-growth year.

(10) Investor Sentiment on AI Is Still Mixed; Awaiting Clarity on 2026 Growth:
• Investors at the conference expressed mixed reactions regarding AI data center infrastructure demand, with long-term supporters waiting for confirmation of sustained growth beyond ’26.
• While concerns over a slowdown in AI capex following DeepSeek have not materialized, there is a need for reassurance that robust investment will continue into ’26.
• It is anticipated that visibility on AI capex will improve in the coming months, with AI infrastructure investment growth in ’26 projected to be at least +15–20% (with potential for further increases if China’s recent AI capex trends persist, e.g., BABA).
• In non-data center AI sectors, many investors are seeking Edge AI investment opportunities through smartphones and PCs, but demand trends in these markets remain uncertain.
• In the short term, as GB200 supply conditions improve and AI capex remains strong, investor attention is expected to shift back to the NVDA supply chain.",1740590296.0,Charuru,32,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1iysqfl/b200_rampup_has_improved_gb300_mid_25_rubin_mid_26/,"B200 Ramp-up has improved; GB300 mid 25, Rubin mid 26 https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1894674450374967455

• SKH anticipates that the HBM supply shortage will persist until ’26, and as the market transitions to HBM3E 12hi/HBM4, ASPs are expected to rise.
• Moreover, from HBM4/4E onward, standardization is unlikely, leading to an increased demand for customization.
• For commodity DRAM, both SKH and SEC expect a modest improvement in market conditions from 2H ’25, driven by 1) increased Edge AI and 2) a volume transition from D4 to D5.

(6) Smartphone – Edge AI Hopes Are High; Need More Evidence to Substantiate Unit Upside:
• The trend toward smartphone specification upgrades and premiumization continues, and while expectations for Edge AI are high, tangible increases in demand remain to be verified.
• There is insufficient evidence to strongly support the idea that Edge AI will shorten the smartphone replacement cycle.
• Apple’s performance in ’25 might remain somewhat stagnant without significant changes, but growth recovery is expected in ’26 with the introduction of new form factors (e.g., a foldable iPhone).

(7) 2Q Caution in Consumer Electronics After Strong 1Q Pull-In:
• Several fabless companies experienced strong pull-in in 1Q ’25 due to potential Chinese subsidies and tariff impositions, but they warn of a potential slowdown in growth in 2Q ’25 (as evidenced by Realtek’s downward guidance and recent cuts by Unimicron noted by JPMorgan).
• Although investor expectations have already been lowered, the anticipated slowdown in demand during 2Q ’25 is a negative factor for the Taiwanese fabless industry.
• However, Novatek and ASMedia are expected to maintain relatively positive momentum in 2Q ’25 due to new product cycles and market share expansion.

(8) Resilient PCs in 1H25, with Strengthening Gaming Tailwinds:
• Laptop ODMs and PC semiconductor suppliers forecast strong demand in 1H ’25, exceeding seasonal averages.
• Despite the impact of tariff-avoidance pre-orders in 4Q ’24, Q1 ’25 is expected to show robust growth driven by inventory build-up ahead of new product launches. However, the growth rate for PC components may slightly decelerate due to the pre-order effect.
• While commercial PC demand has not yet recovered, gaming PC demand is rebounding strongly with the launch of the RTX50 series, and the overall PC TAM is projected to grow by +MSD this year.

(9) Cyclical Tech Demand Not Showing Any Signs of Improvement:
• Although companies such as ADI and IFX have seen a slight rebound, overall recovery signals in cyclical tech demand remain absent.
• Inventory levels in the automotive and industrial sectors continue to be high, with most foundries and OSATs operating at 60–70% capacity.
• Even though inventory levels in the consumer electronics sector are low, sustained recovery in end demand following the 1Q ’25 pre-orders is critical.
• Recovery in the automotive and industrial sectors is expected to start as early as 2H ’25, with wafer raw material suppliers commenting that ’25 might be a no-growth year.

(10) Investor Sentiment on AI Is Still Mixed; Awaiting Clarity on 2026 Growth:
• Investors at the conference expressed mixed reactions regarding AI data center infrastructure demand, with long-term supporters waiting for confirmation of sustained growth beyond ’26.
• While concerns over a slowdown in AI capex following DeepSeek have not materialized, there is a need for reassurance that robust investment will continue into ’26.
• It is anticipated that visibility on AI capex will improve in the coming months, with AI infrastructure investment growth in ’26 projected to be at least +15–20% (with potential for further increases if China’s recent AI capex trends persist, e.g., BABA).
• In non-data center AI sectors, many investors are seeking Edge AI investment opportunities through smartphones and PCs, but demand trends in these markets remain uncertain.
• In the short term, as GB200 supply conditions improve and AI capex remains strong, investor attention is expected to shift back to the NVDA supply chain."

# Stock Market Outlook for Feb. 24-28, 2025

# Key Events Shaping the Market

The stock market is currently searching for direction, and two major events next week could be pivotal:

1. **Nvidia's Earnings Report** – Investors are eagerly awaiting Nvidia’s performance update, as the AI giant faces uncertainty following China’s DeepSeek developments.
2. **Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Data** – The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge will impact monetary policy decisions.

# Market Trends & Uncertainty

* Nvidia needs to show it can navigate economic uncertainty and continue growing.

# 5. Overcome Wall Street Skepticism

* Some firms, like Deutsche Bank, are cautious and only give Nvidia a $140 price target.
* A big earnings beat could force upgrades from analysts, boosting stock prices.

# Potential Market Reactions:

* Bullish Scenario: Nvidia beats earnings expectations, gives strong AI outlook, and clears $150-$160 → Market rally.
* Bearish Scenario: Nvidia misses estimates, warns of AI slowdown or tariff issues, and stock drops below $130→ Market selloff.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed the recent $600 billion market sell-off of Nvidia stock, stating that investors misunderstood the implications of DeepSeek's AI advancements.

DeepSeek, a Chinese AI firm, released an efficient open-source AI model (R1) in January, built with weaker chips and less funding than Western AI models. This led investors to question whether the massive spending on AI infrastructure, including Nvidia’s high-powered chips, was necessary.

Huang countered this notion, emphasizing that while pre-training AI models is important, post-training (reasoning and inference) is even more critical, and it still requires substantial computing power. He argued that AI model scaling is not in trouble, as improvements are now shifting from training to inference.

Grok 3 blew my mind with how good it is. I think yall will enjoy (tried on GPT and perplexity and the results were poor)","Let’s dive into analyzing NVIDIA (NVDA) stock, focusing on its long-term chart, recent earnings events, and making a mathematically informed prediction for its performance around the February 26-28, 2025 earnings release. I’ll leverage available data, historical patterns, and some quantitative reasoning to provide a clear picture. Since today is February 20, 2025, we’re looking at a near-term event just six days away, so this will blend current trends with past behavior.Long-Term Chart AnalysisNVIDIA’s stock has been a powerhouse over the past decade, driven by its dominance in GPUs for gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence (AI). Starting from its all-time low of $0.03 on April 26, 1999 (adjusted for splits), NVDA reached an all-time high of $153.13 on January 7, 2025. As of February 13, 2025, it closed at $135.29, reflecting a market cap of $3.212 trillion. The long-term chart shows a parabolic rise since 2023, fueled by AI demand, with occasional pullbacks.

* Trend: The stock has followed a strong uptrend, with key support from its 50-day moving average (around $130-$134 recently) and occasional tests of the 200-day moving average (last significant drop below it was early February 2025). The 20-week moving average has also acted as a dynamic support level.
* Volatility: NVDA’s beta is 1.62 (5-year monthly), indicating it’s 62% more volatile than the market. Daily volatility is around 2.92%, suggesting significant price swings are normal.
* Key Levels: Resistance sits near the all-time high of $153.13, with support around $130-$135 (50-day MA) and $120-$125 (200-day MA).

Over the long term, NVDA’s compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) from fiscal 2021 to 2024 are impressive: revenue at 53.69%, net income at 80.62%, and operating cash flow at 55.85%. This reflects a company capitalizing on secular growth in AI and computing, supporting the chart’s upward trajectory.Recent Earnings EventsNVIDIA’s last few earnings reports provide insight into how the stock reacts to results and guidance. Here’s a breakdown of the past three quarters (all post-market releases):

1. Q3 FY2025 (November 20, 2024)  
   * Reported: Revenue $35.1B (beat $33.17B estimate), EPS $0.81 (beat $0.75).  
   * Guidance: Q4 revenue expected at $37.5B ± 2%.  
   * Stock Reaction: Dropped 7% over the next five days, then recovered within two weeks. Initial sell-off likely due to high expectations or profit-taking, but the rebound showed resilience.
2. Q2 FY2025 (August 28, 2024)  
   * Reported: Revenue $30.07B (beat $28.7B), EPS $0.68 (beat $0.64).  
   * Reaction: Mixed; initial dip followed by a rally as AI demand optimism kicked in. Stock gained \~10% over the next month.  
   * Context: Supply constraints were noted, but Blackwell chip anticipation buoyed sentiment.
3. Q1 FY2025 (May 22, 2024)  
   * Reported: Revenue $26.04B (beat $24.65B), EPS $0.61 (beat $0.58).  
   * Reaction: Surged \~15% post-earnings, reflecting a strong beat and bullish AI narrative.

Pattern: NVDA consistently beats estimates (100% of the last 12 months), with revenue surprises averaging 5-8%. Post-earnings moves are volatile—downward pressure if expectations are sky-high, upward if guidance exceeds forecasts. The November 2024 dip suggests the market occasionally punishes NVDA for not “beating by enough,” but recoveries are swift.Current Context (February 2025)

* Price: As of February 14, 2025, NVDA closed at $138.85, up 2.63% from $135.29 the prior day, with high volume (195M shares vs. 244M average).  
* Sentiment: Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish—41 rate it “Strong Buy” with a 12-month target of $169.53-$178.83 (25-28% upside). Posts on X suggest optimism tied to upcoming earnings and hyperscaler capex increases (e.g., Meta, Alphabet, Amazon).  
* Technicals: A bullish engulfing candle formed the week of February 10, pushing NVDA above the 20-week MA, signaling a potential intermediate-term low. RSI is neutral (\~50), and MACD shows budding momentum.

Mathematical Prediction for February 26-28, 2025Let’s predict NVDA’s price movement using a combination of historical earnings reactions, implied volatility, and analyst expectations.

1. Earnings Expectations  
   * Q4 FY2025 (ending January 2025): Consensus EPS is $0.84 (up 61.54% YoY), revenue $37.98B (up from $35.08B last quarter). NVIDIA guided $37.5B ± 2% ($36.75B-$38.25B), so a beat is plausible given their track record.  
   * Assume a 6% revenue beat (historical average): $40.26B. EPS could hit $0.89 if margins hold (73% GAAP guided).
2. Historical Post-Earnings Move  
   * Average absolute move post-earnings: \~10% (Q1 +15%, Q2 ±5%, Q3 -7%).  
   * Direction depends on guidance. If Q1 FY2026 guidance exceeds $42B (analyst estimate), expect a positive move; if in-line or below, a dip is likely.
3. Volatility Adjustment  
   * Implied volatility is high pre-earnings (typical for NVDA), suggesting a ±10-15% swing. With a current price of $138.85 and 2.92% daily volatility, a 3-day range could be $125-$155 without earnings, but the event will amplify this.
4. Scenario Analysis  
   * Bull Case: Strong beat ($40B+, EPS $0.90) and guidance ($43B+). Stock rallies 12% to $155.50 by February 28.  
   * Base Case: Modest beat ($39B, EPS $0.87), in-line guidance ($41B). Stock rises 5% to $145.80, then stabilizes.  
   * Bear Case: In-line results ($37.5B, EPS $0.84), cautious guidance ($40B). Stock drops 8% to $127.75 due to high expectations.
5. Probability Weighting  
   * Bull: 40% (consistent beats, AI hype).  
   * Base: 45% (most likely given guidance alignment).  
   * Bear: 15% (only if supply issues or China concerns dominate).  
   * Expected Price: (0.4 × $155.50) + (0.45 × $145.80) + (0.15 × $127.75) = $62.20 + $65.61 + $19.16 = $146.97.

PredictionBased on NVIDIA’s growth trajectory, earnings beat history, and current momentum, I predict NVDA will trade around $147 by February 28, 2025, post-earnings on February 26. This assumes a modest beat and solid guidance, driving a 5-7% gain from $138.85, tempered by potential profit-taking. The stock could spike to $155 intraday if the beat is exceptional, or dip to $130 if sentiment sours, but $147 balances the probabilities.Caveats

* Risks: Geopolitical tensions (e.g., Trump tariffs), supply chain hiccups, or a DeepSeek-like AI efficiency scare could trigger a sell-off.  
* Upside: Blackwell ramp-up or hyperscaler capex surprises could push it past $150.  
* Volatility: Expect a wild ride—options traders are betting on big swings.

In short, NVDA’s long-term strength and earnings momentum suggest an upward bias, but the exact outcome hinges on guidance. I’d lean cautiously bullish, eyeing $147 as a realistic target. 

TLDR: Mathematically, its best prediction is $147 on Friday.",1740061985.0,TampaFan04,143,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1itztsl/i_asked_grok_3_to_analyze_nvda_stock_its_past/,"I asked Grok 3 to analyze NVDA stock, Its past earnings, technical analysis, an theortiical math to predict and give odds on likely outcomes for Feb 26-28.

   * Expected Price: (0.4 × $155.50) + (0.45 × $145.80) + (0.15 × $127.75) = $62.20 + $65.61 + $19.16 = $146.97.

PredictionBased on NVIDIA’s growth trajectory, earnings beat history, and current momentum, I predict NVDA will trade around $147 by February 28, 2025, post-earnings on February 26. This assumes a modest beat and solid guidance, driving a 5-7% gain from $138.85, tempered by potential profit-taking. The stock could spike to $155 intraday if the beat is exceptional, or dip to $130 if sentiment sours, but $147 balances the probabilities.Caveats

* Risks: Geopolitical tensions (e.g., Trump tariffs), supply chain hiccups, or a DeepSeek-like AI efficiency scare could trigger a sell-off.  
* Upside: Blackwell ramp-up or hyperscaler capex surprises could push it past $150.  
* Volatility: Expect a wild ride—options traders are betting on big swings.

In short, NVDA’s long-term strength and earnings momentum suggest an upward bias, but the exact outcome hinges on guidance. I’d lean cautiously bullish, eyeing $147 as a realistic target. 

TLDR: Mathematically, its best prediction is $147 on Friday."

1iok0bv,NVDA_Stock,TSMC US board secret talks: Trump floats three options to boost Intel,"DIGITIMES: Three proposals the United States has presented to TSMC.

1. TSMC would build an advanced packaging facility in the US, offering integrated services from wafer manufacturing to backend processing locally.
2. Under a joint venture (JV) proposed by the US government, TSMC along with several major companies would invest in Intel’s standalone foundry business and facilitate a technology transfer from TSMC.
3. Intel would assume future packaging contracts from US customers that TSMC has secured, leveraging Intel’s advanced packaging capabilities.

Regarding the first proposal, TSMC has previously shown reluctance to construct a packaging plant in the US due to labor shortages and low profit margins. There are also concerns that such a plant could impact TSMC’s backend partners like Amkor Technology.

The second proposal, the joint venture plan, is led by the US government, with sources indicating that the key point is for TSMC and several major companies to jointly invest in Intel’s foundry business, including a technology transfer from TSMC.

The third proposal entails Intel handling additional packaging orders from US customers that TSMC has secured. For instance, companies like Apple, which have already agreed to wafer production at TSMC’s US fab, have prior experience collaborating with Intel.

According to semiconductor industry sources, amid the US government’s drive to reinforce the domestic “Made in America” policy and implement measures to ensure Intel’s survival, TSMC is being cited as virtually the only solution.

1injf9h,NVDA_Stock,Nvidia AI Server-Maker Hon Hai Signals Stronger Revenue Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the main supplier of Nvidia Corp. AI servers, posted a 3% rise in January sales and strengthened its first-quarter outlook.

Hon Hai, also the world’s largest assembler of Apple Inc. iPhones, reported revenue of NT$538.7 billion ($16.4 billion) last month. The comparison with 2024 was skewed by the fact that the week-long Lunar New Year break fell this year in January, versus February 2024.

As Nvidia’s most important AI server maker, Hon Hai’s performance is a bellwether for the AI infrastructure build-out. It said first-quarter sequential growth, or the increase from the December quarter, would be “better than the average level” of the past five years. That’s a rosier projection than the “roughly similar levels” the company teased last month. Growth on a year-over-year basis will be strong, a better outlook as well than that stated before.

Hon Hai, which ships electronics to the rest of the world from giant production bases in China, is grappling this year with uncertainty surrounding Trump-administration tariffs and the sustainability of the AI boom. While big tech firms from Microsoft Corp. to Amazon.com Inc. this month pledged to continue spending to keep pace with a revolutionary technology, Chinese startup DeepSeek’s rise has spurred doubts about whether all that infrastructure expenditure is justified.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: 

Hon Hai’s future growth is increasingly tied to AI servers — a segment in which it competes with other original design manufacturers such as Quanta, Inventec and Wistron. Though the company is set to remain the largest iPhone assembler for the foreseeable future, it’s slowly ceding share to rivals Luxshare and Tata. Hon Hai’s sales growth aligns with electronics manufacturing peers, with robust growth in the cloud segment offset by slower consumer electronics. Its profitability and valuation are both below peer average, dragged lower by iPhone assembly operations.

1inbfdz,NVDA_Stock,"NVDA Q4 FY 2025 Earnings, Revenue, and Guidance Estimates, First $40B Quarter?","First, I am not an equities analyst and the following arguments are those of a retail NVDA stockholder. This perspective is still valuable; other opinions and comments are welcome. TLDR at the bottom.

  
**Revenue Estimate:**   
In Q3, NVDA reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.81 on $35.08B of revenue, which “beat expectations” of \~$0.75 EPS and \~ $33.2B. Twenty-four hours after the report's release, the stock was up around 0.5%. 

In that report, NVDA provided the following guidance for Q4: 

NVIDIA’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is as follows: 

* 1. Revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. 
* 2. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.0% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
* 3. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. 
* 4. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities. 
* 5. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. 

This guidance with macroeconomic, industry, and company-specific trends throughout the quarter helped analysts create NVDA’s Q4 EPS and revenue expectations ($0.85 EPS on $38.02B). The current consensus of $38.02B is about 1.3% higher than the midpoint guidance from NVDA ($37.5B). 

In the last eight quarters, the analyst consensus for revenue has been higher than the company’s midpoint all eight times, by an average of about 1.7%. The company also “beat” these expectations for earnings and revenue in all eight quarters. 

It is worth noting that in the four most recently reported quarters, analyst estimates surpassed NVDA’s midpoint guidance by an average of 2.36% and no quarter was below +2.0%. NVDA reported higher than analyst estimates every time by an average of \~6% (median 5.7%). 

Using the above data, the following statements can be logically concluded: 

1. Analysts were too conservative when projecting NVDA revenue 8 of the last 8 quarters 

2. Analysts have a historically conservative estimate in Q4 relative to previous quarters (+1.3%) 

Relative to the company-issued guidance, this is the closest analyst consensus since Q2 FY24 when estimates were $11.19B vs $11.0B midpoint guidance. Actual revenue came in at $13.51B, a beat of over 20%. 

So why is the consensus for revenue more conservative this quarter? Slowing data center revenue from peers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) could be the answer. While having key differences, AMD’s decelerating data center revenue is a possible reason analysts are less aggressive on NVDA. AMD reported $3.86B in data center revenue, up from $3.5B in Q3. This missed expectations of $4.14B, however. 

AMD’s data center revenue increased about 11% QoQ, down dramatically from the 25% sequential growth reported in Q3. NVDA’s Q3 sequential growth was 17%, does that mean they will drop to single digits? 

No, due to considering company specifics. 

First, $3.5B Q3 data-center revenue is peanuts to the $30.8B data-center revenue NVDA reported Q3. It also shows the companies are in different stages of scaling. AMD’s report mentioned their goals to “ramp up” production. This is similar to the narrative NVDA gave when reporting nearly $4B in data center revenue in 2022. Below is a comparison of data center revenue between AMD (top) and NVDA (bottom).

AMD’s weaker-than-expected results cannot reliably predict weak numbers from NVDA, even though data centers are key segments for both companies. It seems to have affected analyst consensus, however, which could be a mistake. 

Overall to reach $40.00B in Q4 revenue, NVDA needs to exceed historically conservative expectations by less than their average. Data center industry strength and company-specific efficiency will continue to propel NVDA revenue surprises, despite analyst concerns stemming from competition, or a possible weakening macro. 

**Final Total Revenue Estimate: $40.65B** 



**EPS Estimate:** 

It is valuable to talk about how EPS is calculated before the headline number prints. First, what is it? 

EPS stands for Earnings per Share and is calculated by taking the **Net Income** of the company and dividing it by the number of shares on the market. EPS also is usually calculated in two ways: GAAP and non-GAAP. 

GAAP stands for “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” and is a more standardized way to assess profitability amongst companies that may differ greatly. The number you will see when the earnings report is released though is non-GAAP, or in the case of NVDA “diluted earnings per share” at the bottom of their income statement. 

What’s the difference? While non-GAAP reporting still does require companies to adhere to certain regulations, it gives the company more leeway in their calculation which, in theory, provides a more company-specific view of the company’s profit. 

How is Net Income calculated? Again, this will differ between GAAP and Non-GAAP but the process is the same. 

The calculation first starts with the company’s total revenue, which for NVDA last quarter was $35.08B. Revenue is then multiplied by **Gross Margin**, which for NVDA in the previous quarter was 75% and 74.6% for Non-GAAP and GAAP respectively. 

For simplicity and practicality, this calculation will focus on non-GAAP EPS: $35.08B\*0.75=$26.3115B. 

Now $26.3115B is taken and company-issued **Operating Expense** is subtracted. For NVDA’s previous quarter, operating expenses totaled $3.046B (Non-GAAP). $26.3115B-$3.046= \~$23.27B which is listed on the income statement under “Operating Income” as 23,276 Million. 

It is important to note that this is not the number used to calculate EPS. There are steps needed to get from Operating Income to **Net Income**, which is the number used in the final EPS calculation.

While Operating Income is generally considered the profit of the core business, companies will incur “Non-Operating Expenses” each quarter which lowers their net earnings. There is a wide range of costs that can be considered Non-Operating Expenses, from debt payments and losses on the sales of assets to restructuring costs and lawsuits. This leads to variability and a hard-to-predict segment of a company’s income statement. 

Revisiting NVDA’s previous quarter, Non-Operating Expenses can be calculated to be $3.266B even without explicitly listing it. The line following the Operating income in NVDA’s report is Net Income of $20.01B. 

Since the relationship between Operating income and net income can be written as: 

Net income = Operating income - Non-Operating Expenses 

The calculation is $20.01B = $23.276B - Non-Operating Expenses, which returns $3.266B. 

Now that $20.01B in net income is understood, getting the headline EPS number requires dividing by the number of shares of NVDA, which can change due to share offerings, stock splits, or company share buybacks. This info may or may not be provided directly, but can be calculated similarly to Non-Operating expenses by working backward from EPS and looking at company buyback authorizations.

In NVDA’s case, last quarter’s headline EPS was $0.81 on $20.01B of net income on November 20th, 2024, and was split-adjusted. The company repurchased almost $11B worth of shares in the quarter, and still has \~$46.5B of authorized share repurchasing, without expiration. Considering this, and that NVDA’s balance sheet indicates an increase in Cash and Cash equivalents YTD, the shares used in the current quarter calculation will decrease from 24,774M to 24,700M (\~70M shares repurchased @ \~$130/share = \~ $9.5B vs $11B in Q3). 

Returning to NVDA’s guidance for the current quarter, 

“Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.4B” 

This guidance has proven to be more reliable than the revenue forecast, as for the last three quarters that guidance has been off by 0.04% in Q1, -0.28% in Q2, and this quarter they exceeded guidance for Operating Expenses by 1.5%. 

Still, this is an average delta of 0.4% and 0.6% depending on accuracy calculated by the total difference from actuals or delta from 0.00%. Given previous accuracy, the guided $3.4B will be used in current quarter estimates. 

Margin guidance has also been recently accurate (0.00% off most recently), which suggests assuming current guidance for Q4 which is 73.5%. 

Now for the EPS estimate. This all starts from total revenue, so if the first estimate is inaccurate, it is likely the EPS calculation will also differ significantly. 

Q4 Total Revenue: $40.65B 

Gross Margin: 73.5% 

Operating Expenses: $4.3B 

Operating Income: $25.58B 

Non-Operating Expenses: Between $3.6B and $4.0B\* 

Net Income: Between $21.58B and $21.98B 

Shares used in calculation 24.70B 

\*This segment grew 9.5% QoQ in Q3 yet is up 178% YoY. The estimated range represents between \~10.5% and 22% QoQ growth or between \~175% and 200% growth YoY which is an assumption. Given there is little company-provided data, the estimate is a conservative range. 

**Final EPS Estimate: $0.88** 

  


**TL;DR:** 

EPS:$0.88 vs $0.85est 

Revenue: $40.65B vs $38.02B 

Guidance: “Revenue is expected to be $42.0B, plus or minus 2%” 

Stock Reaction: Stock Moves Higher

This is not financial advice. ",1739312947.0,hazxrrd,97,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1inbfdz/nvda_q4_fy_2025_earnings_revenue_and_guidance/,"NVDA Q4 FY 2025 Earnings, Revenue, and Guidance Estimates, First $40B Quarter? First, I am not an equities analyst and the following arguments are those of a retail NVDA stockholder. This perspective is still valuable; other opinions and comments are welcome. TLDR at the bottom.

  
**Revenue Estimate:**   
In Q3, NVDA reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.81 on $35.08B of revenue, which “beat expectations” of \~$0.75 EPS and \~ $33.2B. Twenty-four hours after the report's release, the stock was up around 0.5%. 

In that report, NVDA provided the following guidance for Q4: 

NVIDIA’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is as follows: 

* 1. Revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. 
* 2. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.0% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
* 3. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. 
* 4. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities. 
* 5. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. 

This guidance with macroeconomic, industry, and company-specific trends throughout the quarter helped analysts create NVDA’s Q4 EPS and revenue expectations ($0.85 EPS on $38.02B). The current consensus of $38.02B is about 1.3% higher than the midpoint guidance from NVDA ($37.5B). 

In the last eight quarters, the analyst consensus for revenue has been higher than the company’s midpoint all eight times, by an average of about 1.7%. The company also “beat” these expectations for earnings and revenue in all eight quarters. 

It is worth noting that in the four most recently reported quarters, analyst estimates surpassed NVDA’s midpoint guidance by an average of 2.36% and no quarter was below +2.0%. NVDA reported higher than analyst estimates every time by an average of \~6% (median 5.7%). 

Using the above data, the following statements can be logically concluded: 

1. Analysts were too conservative when projecting NVDA revenue 8 of the last 8 quarters 

2. Analysts have a historically conservative estimate in Q4 relative to previous quarters (+1.3%) 

Relative to the company-issued guidance, this is the closest analyst consensus since Q2 FY24 when estimates were $11.19B vs $11.0B midpoint guidance. Actual revenue came in at $13.51B, a beat of over 20%. 

So why is the consensus for revenue more conservative this quarter? Slowing data center revenue from peers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) could be the answer. While having key differences, AMD’s decelerating data center revenue is a possible reason analysts are less aggressive on NVDA. AMD reported $3.86B in data center revenue, up from $3.5B in Q3. This missed expectations of $4.14B, however. 

AMD’s data center revenue increased about 11% QoQ, down dramatically from the 25% sequential growth reported in Q3. NVDA’s Q3 sequential growth was 17%, does that mean they will drop to single digits? 

No, due to considering company specifics.

# Current Market Cap and Stock Performance

* **Market Cap & Price:** Nvidia’s market cap stands at roughly $3 trillion (briefly surpassing $3.3 trillion in late 2024), with shares trading in the mid-$120s–$130s.
* **Recent Performance:** The stock has experienced explosive gains (170% in 2024 and 240% in 2023) driven by its AI chip dominance but has recently consolidated. Technical support appears around $130 (with additional support near $115), while resistance is observed near $140–$150. Volatility remains high; for example, a 17% drop in January 2025 wiped out over $600 billion in market value amid fears of a new Chinese AI competitor.

# Financial Performance and Growth Outlook

* **Record Earnings:** In Q3 2025, Nvidia posted $35.1B in revenue—a 94% YoY increase—with its data center business (including AI accelerator chips) generating $30.8B (112% YoY growth). Non-GAAP EPS reached about $0.81, with net income around $19B.
* **Growth Projections:** Guidance for Q4 FY2025 forecasts revenue of approximately $37.5B (±2%), potentially pushing full-year FY2025 revenue to around $110–112B—roughly triple the revenue from two years ago. Projections suggest that fiscal 2026 revenue could exceed $200B, with some analysts predicting earnings per share could double.

# Key Drivers: AI Demand and Blackwell Launch

* **AI Boom:** The surge in demand for AI applications is fueling unprecedented need for Nvidia’s GPUs, which dominate the AI accelerator market (an estimated 80%+ share). Major tech companies have dramatically increased orders to build AI capacity.
* **Blackwell Launch:** The upcoming next-generation “Blackwell” GPU architecture is expected to deliver significant performance improvements and drive an upgrade cycle across data centers and consumer segments. Pre-orders for Blackwell chips are robust, suggesting strong revenue momentum in the coming quarters.
* **Higher Profit Potential:** Recent strong Q4 earnings from Mag 7 stocks (reflecting robust capital expenditure and higher compute demand) indicate that the $37B quarterly profit estimate could be conservative.

# Macroeconomic and Industry Factors

* **Interest Rates & Economic Environment:** While high interest rates typically pressure high-growth tech stocks, Nvidia’s explosive earnings have so far offset these headwinds. However, sustained “higher-for-longer” rates or an economic downturn could temper growth.
* **Semiconductor Cycle & AI Capex:** Although semiconductor cycles remain relevant, the current AI boom—characterized by record capex from enterprise and cloud providers—has decoupled Nvidia from traditional cycles. Global AI spending is projected to keep rising sharply.

# Competitive Landscape

* **Major Rivals:** AMD has made notable strides with its MI300 series accelerators, and Intel is making moves in the AI accelerator space. Additionally, custom silicon from major tech companies (e.g., Google TPUs, AWS Trainium) adds competition.
* **Ecosystem Advantage:** Despite these challenges, Nvidia’s advanced hardware, mature software ecosystem (CUDA and AI libraries), and strong industry partnerships have kept it at the forefront, maintaining a commanding market share.

# 12-Month Stock Price Outlook

* **1 Month (Mar 2025):** With Q4 earnings expected in late February, the stock may hover around $130. A strong earnings beat or bullish guidance could push it above $140.
* **3 Months (May 2025):** As early signals from Blackwell shipments emerge and market sentiment recovers from recent dips, the stock could reach the $140–$160 range.
* **6 Months (Aug 2025):** With Blackwell in full swing and further earnings growth, a move into the mid-$150s to $170 range is plausible.
* **9 Months (Nov 2025):** Continued robust performance could drive the stock toward $170–$180 as more data solidifies the AI demand narrative.
* **12 Months (Feb 2026):** Consensus price targets of $180–$200 (or higher) are expected if Nvidia meets or exceeds its growth projections, particularly if current profit estimates are revised upward based on stronger-than-expected AI capex and compute demand.

# Risks and Downside Factors

* **Valuation & Sentiment:** High valuation means little room for error; even minor setbacks could lead to sharp corrections.
* **Competitive Pressures:** Increased competition from AMD, Intel, and custom solutions could erode Nvidia’s market share or pressure pricing.
* **Macroeconomic & Geopolitical Risks:** Prolonged high interest rates, economic downturns, U.S.-China tensions, and reliance on critical suppliers (like TSMC) pose significant risks.
* **Execution Risks:** Any delays or issues with Blackwell or supply chain disruptions could negatively impact revenue growth and investor sentiment.
* **Innovation Risk:** If Nvidia’s performance gains with Blackwell or future architectures fail to meet expectations, its technological edge could be challenged.

# Conclusion

Nvidia has become one of the world’s most valuable companies thanks to its leadership in AI hardware and exceptional revenue growth. The upcoming Blackwell launch and ongoing global AI investment are key catalysts likely to drive further growth into 2025 and beyond. Although there are risks—including high valuation, competitive pressures, and macroeconomic uncertainties—the fundamental outlook remains bullish. Our base-case scenario sees Nvidia’s stock trending upward over the next 12 months, potentially reaching the $180–$200 range by early 2026, with the possibility of even higher profit estimates reflecting stronger-than-expected demand.",1739049656.0,wanderingtofu,88,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1iky07c/nvidia_nvda_valuation_and_outlook_by_chatgpt_deep/,"Nvidia (NVDA) Valuation and Outlook - By ChatGPT Deep Research Mode # Nvidia (NVDA) Valuation and Outlook – By ChatGPT Deep Research Mode

# Current Market Cap and Stock Performance

* **Market Cap & Price:** Nvidia’s market cap stands at roughly $3 trillion (briefly surpassing $3.3 trillion in late 2024), with shares trading in the mid-$120s–$130s.
* **Recent Performance:** The stock has experienced explosive gains (170% in 2024 and 240% in 2023) driven by its AI chip dominance but has recently consolidated. Technical support appears around $130 (with additional support near $115), while resistance is observed near $140–$150. Volatility remains high; for example, a 17% drop in January 2025 wiped out over $600 billion in market value amid fears of a new Chinese AI competitor.

# Financial Performance and Growth Outlook

* **Record Earnings:** In Q3 2025, Nvidia posted $35.1B in revenue—a 94% YoY increase—with its data center business (including AI accelerator chips) generating $30.8B (112% YoY growth). Non-GAAP EPS reached about $0.81, with net income around $19B.
* **Growth Projections:** Guidance for Q4 FY2025 forecasts revenue of approximately $37.5B (±2%), potentially pushing full-year FY2025 revenue to around $110–112B—roughly triple the revenue from two years ago. Projections suggest that fiscal 2026 revenue could exceed $200B, with some analysts predicting earnings per share could double.

# Key Drivers: AI Demand and Blackwell Launch

* **AI Boom:** The surge in demand for AI applications is fueling unprecedented need for Nvidia’s GPUs, which dominate the AI accelerator market (an estimated 80%+ share). Major tech companies have dramatically increased orders to build AI capacity.
* **Blackwell Launch:** The upcoming next-generation “Blackwell” GPU architecture is expected to deliver significant performance improvements and drive an upgrade cycle across data centers and consumer segments. Pre-orders for Blackwell chips are robust, suggesting strong revenue momentum in the coming quarters.
* **Higher Profit Potential:** Recent strong Q4 earnings from Mag 7 stocks (reflecting robust capital expenditure and higher compute demand) indicate that the $37B quarterly profit estimate could be conservative.

1ijmk46,NVDA_Stock,Everybody loves an underdog,"# AI chip firm Cerebras partners with France's Mistral, claims speed record

Reuters9:04 PM ET Feb-06-2025

By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) - Cerebras Systems, an artificial intelligence chip firm backed by UAE tech conglomerate G42, said on Thursday it has partnered with France's Mistral and has helped the European AI player achieve a speed record.

Mistral, a maker of open-source AI technology, is aiming to challenge fellow open-source contenders Meta Platforms (META.NaE) and China's DeepSeek, which rocked global markets late last month with claims of cutting-edge performance at low cost. All three compete with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

On Thursday, Mistral released an app called Le Chat that it said can respond to user questions with 1,000 words per second.

Cerebras said it is providing the computer power behind those results, which it claimed makes Mistral the world's fastest AI assistant, ahead of both OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Silicon Valley-based Cerebras, which has filed for an initial public offering that is delayed while U.S. officials review G42's involvement with the firm, is one of the few challengers to Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) for training AI models. But the partnership with Mistral on Thursday is for serving an app based on its model to users, a step called ""inference"" in the AI industry.

As rivals have closed in on matching OpenAI's models, the speed of delivering answers to users has become more of a priority, said Cerebras Chief Executive Andrew Feldman.

""You want better answers. And to get better answers, you need more compute at inference time,"" Feldman told Reuters.

1ij8x2g,NVDA_Stock,Technical and Fundamental Analysis of $NVDA,"NVDA has seen some turbulent price action recently, caused primarily by the introduction of Chinese AI startup ""Deepseek."" The startup is reported to have cost only 5.6 million dollars to build, putting into question the necessity of allocating billions of dollars to AI infrastructure. I've shared my technical analysis of the stock and a short overview of the fundamentals in play that may affect future price action.    
  
Here’s my breakdown of the current price action and key areas to monitor:  
  
Technical Analysis:  


https://preview.redd.it/ke06taua6khe1.png?width=3147&format=png&auto=webp&s=5faf73a532f9c44e46f9574bdf18872a9c4d104f

📊 Key Observations:  
Support Zones: The Key Bull Zone A held firmly as initial support before the recent rally. Near the Critical Level, the Key Bull Zone B served as a crucial bounce point, aligning with the 200 EMA.  
  
Resistance and Reactions: The price is within the range of a significant supply zone (marked in yellow), which indicates an area with significant selling volume.  
  
Key Resistance Level: Watch for a breakout if the stock closes fully above the $129.03 price point. This could signal a strong bullish continuation as the stock moves forward to fill the gap before hitting its next point of resistance, the 50 EMA at $133.44.   
  
RSI Analysis: The RSI shows a moderate recovery from oversold conditions but has yet to cross into bullish momentum territory.  
  
💡 What’s Next?   
I’m closely watching the reaction in the supply zone. A rejection within this area could lead to a retest of the 200 EMA or even lower levels. Conversely, a decisive break and hold above this zone increases the likelihood of a gap fill and a potential test of the ATH at $152.54.  
  
Brief Fundamental Analysis:  
Earnings could play a crucial role in guiding future price action. According to recent earnings reports from other tech companies, such as Google, companies seek to increase their capital expenditures on AI infrastructure. This is bullish as it eases investors' concerns about the waning demand for NVDA AI GPUs. We will hear NVDA report its earnings for the previous quarter on February 26th, 2025.

According to recent earnings reports from other tech companies, such as Google, companies seek to increase their capital expenditures on AI infrastructure. This is bullish as it eases investors' concerns about the waning demand for NVDA AI GPUs. We will hear NVDA report its earnings for the previous quarter on February 26th, 2025.

1iieb0s,NVDA_Stock,The World Runs on NVIDIA,"This company never ceases to amaze me. I sometimes like to share my thoughts on NVIDIA as to the positives and potential risks facing the business. Three years ago NVIDIA laid out their ~~plans for world domination~~ total addressable market of 1 trillion dollars. Their proposed 1 trillion dollar TAM included 300B in chips and systems, 300B in automotive, 150B in A.I. software, 150B in omniverse software, and 100B in gaming. The current explosion in growth is purely from the chips and systems segment so far but is just the tip of the iceberg for the avenues of growth for the business. A.I. has been the fuel source for the rapid adoption of accelerated computing which is the core of the future of technology. As indicative of their proposed TAM, NVIDIA does not want to remain dependent on hardware sales as nearly a third of their proposed TAM involves software. NVIDIA becoming a software company as well as a hardware company for accelerated computing would be glorious. Enterprise software is an overlooked avenue of growth for the future of NVIDIA because everyone is focused on chip sales right now, but I am confident this is the future of NVIDIA. In addition, I also do believe hardware sales will continue to fuel growth but it will not just be the data center like it is currently; robotics and automotive will be the next application of NVIDIA GPUs into A.I.

The future is bright, but it would be a lie to say that there are not any risks facing the business. Semiconductors are cyclical, and as of now NVIDIA is solely dependent on hardware sales which is why I believe in the future they want to move into software sales as well. It may seem like demand is unlimited right now, but short term hiccups can arise and CapEx spending by their customers can shift on a dime. I know it is hard to believe that will happen, but it is a possibility that we must acknowledge. I am not sure how this semiconductor cycle will play out because in the past NVIDIA was driven by crypto mining sales which have different business dynamics than A.I. data center sales. All I am saying though is be cautious of cyclicality because stocks often look cheap at the top of a cyclical peak.

Another concern I have is retail sentiment towards the stock lately. I joined this subreddit in August 2023 when there were 7,000 members. In the past year, the member count has risen to 80k, notably mostly during the second half of 2024 and beginning of 2025. I think most of the new members are gamblers who bought the stock just because it went up a lot and try to claim they understand the business when they really do not. This is evident by the fact that many of the new members complain when the stock goes down on a one day time frame. If you understood the business and are truly long term, you would not care if it went down in a single day. I think a lot of the new members would not be able to stomach a 50% drop from here and would probably sell out at a loss.

Anyway, I think NVIDIA is the greatest company the world has ever seen and will continue to be because they are opportunistic. I am excited to see how they capitalize on A.I. software sales and continue their foray into A.I. hardware.

1ihag82,NVDA_Stock,TSMC Q4 production and RTX 5090 limited supply launch,"Hello Fellow Apes,

Since there are a lot of people pointing to rumor about the upcoming earning calls for NVDA, I figure I'll throw my in my two cents too. This is to reinforce my bull thesis in the post below.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA\_Stock/comments/1ifi9vy/the\_bull\_thesis\_for\_nvidiadespite\_what\_is\_going\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1ifi9vy/the_bull_thesis_for_nvidiadespite_what_is_going_on/)

In the fourth quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) shipped approximately 3,418,000 12-inch equivalent wafers, marking a 2.4% increase from the previous quarter and a 7.3% rise year-over-year.

[https://epsnews.com/2025/01/21/tsmc-rides-ai-wave-to-record-profits-in-q4/?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://epsnews.com/2025/01/21/tsmc-rides-ai-wave-to-record-profits-in-q4/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The NVIDIA RTX 5090's current understock situation stems from a combination of limited initial supply and overwhelming demand. Upon its release on January 30, 2025, the RTX 5090 sold out rapidly across both physical and online retailers. Reports indicate that some stores received minimal units, while others had none at all. This scarcity has led to the launch being labeled a ""paper launch,"" suggesting that the product was announced without sufficient stock to meet consumer demand.

[https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Given TSMC's strong ties to NVIDIA's earnings, I believe it's reasonable to assume that NVIDIA secured more semiconductor materials this quarter compared to the previous one. This likely resulted in increased production capacity, particularly for their high-margin AI chips. Furthermore, I think NVIDIA intentionally executed a soft launch for the RTX 5090, not due to production constraints, but because they strategically diverted resources towards manufacturing AI chips, which command significantly higher prices and profit margins than consumer GPUs. This explains why the RTX 5090 release felt like a ""paper launch""—there simply wasn't enough supply because their focus was elsewhere. Remember back in the day of crypto mining? Same thing. 

This line of reasoning leads me to believe that NVIDIA's upcoming earnings will surpass those of Q3. Additionally, I don't think this anticipated performance is fully ""priced in"" yet, as the stock is currently trading below even the most conservative analyst forecasts. Given NVIDIA's dominant position in the AI chip market and its consistent revenue growth—pulling in billions—it doesn't make sense for the stock to be as undervalued as it appears right now. The market seems to be underestimating NVIDIA's earnings potential, and I see this as a strong indicator that the company will outperform expectations.",1738646492.0,Rainyfriedtofu,37,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1ihag82/tsmc_q4_production_and_rtx_5090_limited_supply/,"TSMC Q4 production and RTX 5090 limited supply launch Hello Fellow Apes,

The NVIDIA RTX 5090's current understock situation stems from a combination of limited initial supply and overwhelming demand. Upon its release on January 30, 2025, the RTX 5090 sold out rapidly across both physical and online retailers. Reports indicate that some stores received minimal units, while others had none at all. This scarcity has led to the launch being labeled a ""paper launch,"" suggesting that the product was announced without sufficient stock to meet consumer demand.

[https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Given TSMC's strong ties to NVIDIA's earnings, I believe it's reasonable to assume that NVIDIA secured more semiconductor materials this quarter compared to the previous one. This likely resulted in increased production capacity, particularly for their high-margin AI chips. Furthermore, I think NVIDIA intentionally executed a soft launch for the RTX 5090, not due to production constraints, but because they strategically diverted resources towards manufacturing AI chips, which command significantly higher prices and profit margins than consumer GPUs. This explains why the RTX 5090 release felt like a ""paper launch""—there simply wasn't enough supply because their focus was elsewhere. Remember back in the day of crypto mining? Same thing. 

This line of reasoning leads me to believe that NVIDIA's upcoming earnings will surpass those of Q3. Additionally, I don't think this anticipated performance is fully ""priced in"" yet, as the stock is currently trading below even the most conservative analyst forecasts. Given NVIDIA's dominant position in the AI chip market and its consistent revenue growth—pulling in billions—it doesn't make sense for the stock to be as undervalued as it appears right now. The market seems to be underestimating NVIDIA's earnings potential, and I see this as a strong indicator that the company will outperform expectations."
1ih63rf,NVDA_Stock,Rumor: A U.S. securities firm has adjusted [lowered] the shipment forecasts for GB200 and GB300.,"Rumor: A U.S. securities firm has adjusted the shipment forecasts for GB200 and GB300.

- 2382 Quanta: U.S. Investment Bank Lowers Target Price

A major U.S. investment bank has lowered its EPS forecasts for 2025-2026 to $17.1/$19.4 and adjusted its target price downward, based on a 2024 PER of 20x.

The bank has also revised its GB200 shipment forecast for the first half of this year, lowering it from the previous estimate of 5,000–8,000 units to 2,500–4,500 units.

Additionally, the total shipment forecast for GB200 + GB300 in the second half of the year has been reduced from 14,000 units to 8,000 units.

There is also a possibility that the total shipment volume of the GB series in 2025 may be further revised downward.

MORGAN STANLEY: THE SHIPMENT FORECAST FOR NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 THIS YEAR HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REVISED DOWNWARD FROM 30,000–35,000 UNITS TO 20,000–25,000 UNITS, WITH A PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO SUGGESTING THAT SHIPMENTS COULD FALL BELOW 20,000 UNITS.

Morgan Stanley Securities pointed out that as Microsoft’s capital expenditure growth slows and its comments on model efficiency improvements negatively impact the supply chain, the shipment forecast for NVIDIA’s GB200 NVL 72 this year has been significantly revised downward from 30,000–35,000 units to 20,000–25,000 units. In a pessimistic scenario, shipments could even fall below 20,000 units, potentially affecting the overall supply chain by $30–35 billion, adding further volatility to Taiwan’s stock market during the Lunar New Year period.

Although Meta’s capital expenditure for 2025 is relatively strong, Microsoft’s capital expenditure plans do not serve as a positive factor for the supply chain. Morgan Stanley observed that since the third quarter of 2024, investors’ expectations for the GB200 supply chain have surged. However, as uncertainties arise in capital expenditure and quarterly growth remains limited, the annual growth rate of cloud capital expenditure may slow to single-digit percentages by the fourth quarter of 2025.

Given the downward revision of GB200 shipments, Morgan Stanley advises that stocks with over 50% growth in NVIDIA-related capital expenditure and a business model leaning more toward GB200 (e.g., Aspeed Technology, King Yuan Electronics) may have a less attractive risk-reward ratio. In contrast, companies with lower reliance on NVIDIA’s capital expenditure (e.g., Alchip Technologies) may be relatively defensive.

Despite lowering its shipment forecast for GB200 NVL 72 in 2025, Morgan Stanley also noted that networking and power supply remain major bottlenecks for GB200, and resolving these issues will take time.

📰 **Market Highlights**

Over the past week, Nvidia has been at the center of significant developments in the AI and technology sectors. Here's a summary of the key events:

**DeepSeek's AI Breakthrough and Market Impact**

Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled an advanced AI model that matches the performance of leading models but at a fraction of the cost. This innovation led to a substantial decline in Nvidia's stock, erasing nearly $600 billion in market value—the largest single-day loss for a U.S. company. Investors are now reassessing Nvidia's position in the AI hardware market.

**Nvidia's Response and Strategic Initiatives**

In response to DeepSeek's advancements, Nvidia emphasized that its new RTX 50-series GPUs are optimized for running DeepSeek's AI models, highlighting their superior performance on PCs. Additionally, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss AI policy and potential responses to international AI developments. The meeting underscored the importance of strengthening U.S. leadership in AI and technology.

OP note: This kind of misses the whole point, but whatever - good PR lol

**Investor Activity Amid Market Volatility**

Despite the stock downturn, retail investors purchased a record $562.2 million worth of Nvidia shares, indicating confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Similarly, Lockheed Martin's pension fund significantly increased its holdings in Nvidia, adding 233,920 shares to reach a total of 1.3 million shares. Buy the dip mentality.

1ifi9vy,NVDA_Stock,The bull thesis for Nvidia--despite what is going on.,"Hello Fellow Apes, 

I usually don't write about Nvidia DD. However, after seeing so many FUDS post about NVDA which reminded me about the old days of Clover Health from a few years ago, I was motivated by a reader to write a bull thesis for NVDA. Specifically, I am responding to the user below for sending me a DM and reporting me to Reddit care. This was a response to my retrospective post.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA\_Stock/comments/1ibr4eg/a\_retrospective\_of\_chinas\_breakthroughs\_over\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1ibr4eg/a_retrospective_of_chinas_breakthroughs_over_the/) 

https://preview.redd.it/dg8eqakoilge1.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed59eca47787a9150d96fe0d44ae62a1eca08ce2

As a side note, I think people are spreading misinformation and fuds on this reddit and wsb to short Nvda, but the top of this discussion is about NVDA's bull case. We'll start off some basic comparison with big companies.

Nvidia’s trailing twelve-month P/E ratio has been reported in the range of roughly **70**. Recent quarterly reports have indicated an operating margin in the range of **40%**.

Telsa's P/E ratio can be quite volatile given its rapid growth and evolving profitability. Recent data have shown it in the range of **70–80**. net profit margin has generally been lower compared to some established tech giants. In recent reports, Tesla’s net margin has been in the range of roughly **8–12%**. 

Microsoft has more stable earnings, with a P/E ratio typically in the range of **30–35**. Microsoft is known for strong profitability. Recent data typically show a net profit margin in the vicinity of **30–40%**.

Alphabet’s P/E ratio has generally been lower than some of its tech peers, hovering around **25–30**. Alphabet’s net profit margin is generally in a similar ballpark to Apple’s, typically around **20–25%**.

Apple’s P/E ratio is usually in the range of **25–30**. Apple’s net profit margin usually falls in the range of about **20–25%**.

As you can tell from the number above, Nvidia is an excellent company with a high P/E ratio and a very high profit margin--in my opinion. However, beyond just looking at these retrospective metrics, I think it's best that we look into Nvidia manufacturing constraints before we look at why those constraints means very little in the larger picture: Nvdia share price will continue to moon for at least 3 more years. Afterall, Nvidia is selling more chips than it can produced, and there is a huge backorder.

Nvidia’s ability to fulfill orders for its chips isn’t solely determined by its own manufacturing processes—it also depends on broader industry factors like the capacity and schedules of its manufacturing partners (such as TSMC and Samsung) and the overall global semiconductor supply chain. Nvidia has publicly acknowledged supply chain challenges in the past and has worked closely with its manufacturing partners to boost output. For example, in recent quarterly reports and earnings calls, Nvidia executives have detailed efforts to improve supply chain efficiency and capacity. They continue to invest in better forecasting, planning, and partnerships to mitigate these issues. In short, we haven't seen Nvidia selling at it max capacity just yet, and their logistic are going to kick into high gear in 2025.

The point I am making here is that Nvidia will be selling more chips in 2025, and it will not be hindered by the US creating barriers for its adversaries to get their hands on Nvidia. The U.S. government’s efforts to prevent adversaries from obtaining Nvidia’s advanced chips are primarily driven by national security, technological, and strategic considerations. Nvidia’s GPUs are at the forefront of powering artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high-performance computing. These technologies can be used in a wide range of applications—from commercial innovations to advanced military systems. Preventing adversaries from accessing such technology helps maintain the U.S.’s competitive edge in critical technological areas. 

Advanced chips are increasingly viewed as dual-use technologies, meaning they can be applied in both civilian and military contexts. High-performance GPUs can accelerate the development of autonomous systems, intelligence analysis, cybersecurity measures, and other defense-related applications. Ensuring that potential adversaries do not gain easy access to these chips is seen as a way to limit their ability to enhance military capabilities. If you look at the war in Ukraine, you can clearly see that modern warfare is not fought with manual labor, but it is instead determined by technology. AI will be the determining factor in Global dominance in the future. 

In today’s global economy, leadership in semiconductor technology and AI is a major strategic asset. The U.S. aims to preserve its technological lead, which has both economic and security implications. Advanced semiconductor technology underpins a wide array of industries and can directly influence economic competitiveness. Keeping such technology out of the hands of adversaries is part of broader efforts to maintain a technological and economic advantage. The U.S. government has implemented export controls and restrictions on certain technologies to ensure that critical components do not fall into the hands of entities that might use them in ways that could undermine U.S. interests. These measures are designed to secure supply chains and ensure that advanced technologies, such as Nvidia’s chips, do not contribute to the military or cyber capabilities of rival nations. By restricting access to advanced chip technology, the U.S. also aims to strengthen alliances with friendly nations. These countries often share similar concerns regarding national security and technology transfer, and coordinated export controls can help build a more secure global technology ecosystem.

Of course, this doesn't mean Nvidia is making less money. Nvidia is currently selling its high-end AI chips faster than it can produce them. Despite ramping up production—especially with the rollout of its next-generation Blackwell AI chips—the demand for Nvidia's processors continues to outpace supply. This surge is driven by the booming AI sector, where companies are aggressively acquiring powerful chips to fuel advancements in machine learning and data processing. It's gotten so bad and competitive that just about every semiconductor companies are making record breaking profits because NVDA cannot produce and sell chips fast enough. If we take a look at the recent launch of the 5000 series, it looks as if they are neglecting their consumer graphic card business in favor of AI chips and rightfully so.

Nvidia’s chips—especially their high-performance GPUs—have become central to the current technological landscape, and several factors explain why countries and industries are intensely focused on them, as well as why there's an ongoing ""AI race"" Nvidia's GPUs are exceptionally good at handling the parallel processing tasks required for training and running large-scale AI models. This makes them indispensable for industries that rely on machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics. This is why they are considered the ""king.""

From autonomous vehicles to healthcare diagnostics and financial modeling, AI technologies powered by these chips are transforming multiple sectors. Countries see leadership in AI as a way to boost economic competitiveness and national security. Nations that lead in AI innovation are likely to gain significant advantages in both economic growth and military technology. As AI continues to underpin next-generation technologies, controlling the supply of critical components like Nvidia's chips becomes a strategic priority. With a limited number of companies (like Nvidia and its manufacturing partners) capable of producing such advanced chips, global supply chains are vulnerable. This makes countries anxious about ensuring a steady supply of technology essential for AI development. The reason why I am highlighting this is because everyone wants these chips. Therefore, tariff and chips restriction to some countries will not hurt Nvidia's numbers. Someone else will buy them--at any cost. 

Governments and private companies worldwide are heavily investing in AI research and infrastructure. This race is fueled by the promise of AI to drive innovation, create new industries, and solve complex problems. AI has applications in defense, surveillance, and cybersecurity. As such, governments are not only pursuing AI for economic benefits but also for maintaining or enhancing their national security. In a rapidly digitalizing global economy, being at the forefront of AI technology can provide a decisive competitive edge. This is why there's a race to develop better AI algorithms, build robust data ecosystems, and secure the necessary hardware to support these technologies. Regardless of whether it is Deepseek or OpenAi, the linchpin is still the ""King of chips."" 

Furthermore, with rising geopolitical tensions, countries are increasingly interested in ensuring that critical technology like AI hardware is available domestically or through secure supply chains. This can lead to policies aimed at bolstering local production, limiting exports, or forming strategic alliances. Reliance on a few key suppliers for advanced chips can be seen as a vulnerability. As a result, countries are pushing for diversification of supply sources or developing domestic capabilities in semiconductor manufacturing. TSMC building in Arizona? This is for security reason. 

In summary, I believe that the recent surge of negative propaganda against Nvidia is nothing more than FUD that overlooks the company’s critical role in today’s tech landscape. Critics might point to emerging technologies like quantum computing or spotlight various competitors, but these alternatives are still a long way from challenging Nvidia’s dominant position. Just look at the trillions of dollars being invested in AI—this massive influx of capital underscores how essential Nvidia’s technology is to the current digital revolution.

We are at a transformative moment in modern history, comparable to the advent of the internet, and Nvidia stands as a linchpin in this evolution. While the full earnings impact of these trends is still unfolding, upcoming reports from AI and semiconductor companies give us a clear glimpse of the robust performance we can expect from Nvidia in its next earnings cycle. Just look at ASML and AVGO's movements.

Nvidia is unique in that it produces a product that every country and company is eager to acquire. Despite this, we continue to see numerous articles claiming that Nvidia has been dethroned. By what, exactly? Is it because of a chatbot like Deepseek—which, in fact, runs on Nvidia’s chips—or is it due to quantum computing, a technology that currently lacks substantial, revenue-generating industrial applications?

The reality is that Nvidia is well-positioned to remain the industry leader for several more years. Moreover, if TSMC completes its Arizona factory as expected in 2025, we could very well see Nvidia achieving record profits once again. Rather than being swayed by unfounded claims, it’s important to recognize that Nvidia’s technological prowess and strategic importance in the AI and semiconductor sectors remain unparalleled.",1738449089.0,Rainyfriedtofu,100,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1ifi9vy/the_bull_thesis_for_nvidiadespite_what_is_going_on/,"The bull thesis for Nvidia--despite what is going on.

Nvidia’s chips—especially their high-performance GPUs—have become central to the current technological landscape, and several factors explain why countries and industries are intensely focused on them, as well as why there's an ongoing ""AI race"" Nvidia's GPUs are exceptionally good at handling the parallel processing tasks required for training and running large-scale AI models. This makes them indispensable for industries that rely on machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics. This is why they are considered the ""king.""

From autonomous vehicles to healthcare diagnostics and financial modeling, AI technologies powered by these chips are transforming multiple sectors. Countries see leadership in AI as a way to boost economic competitiveness and national security. Nations that lead in AI innovation are likely to gain significant advantages in both economic growth and military technology. As AI continues to underpin next-generation technologies, controlling the supply of critical components like Nvidia's chips becomes a strategic priority. With a limited number of companies (like Nvidia and its manufacturing partners) capable of producing such advanced chips, global supply chains are vulnerable. This makes countries anxious about ensuring a steady supply of technology essential for AI development. The reason why I am highlighting this is because everyone wants these chips. Therefore, tariff and chips restriction to some countries will not hurt Nvidia's numbers. Someone else will buy them--at any cost. 

Governments and private companies worldwide are heavily investing in AI research and infrastructure. This race is fueled by the promise of AI to drive innovation, create new industries, and solve complex problems. AI has applications in defense, surveillance, and cybersecurity. As such, governments are not only pursuing AI for economic benefits but also for maintaining or enhancing their national security. In a rapidly digitalizing global economy, being at the forefront of AI technology can provide a decisive competitive edge. This is why there's a race to develop better AI algorithms, build robust data ecosystems, and secure the necessary hardware to support these technologies. Regardless of whether it is Deepseek or OpenAi, the linchpin is still the ""King of chips."" 

Furthermore, with rising geopolitical tensions, countries are increasingly interested in ensuring that critical technology like AI hardware is available domestically or through secure supply chains. This can lead to policies aimed at bolstering local production, limiting exports, or forming strategic alliances. Reliance on a few key suppliers for advanced chips can be seen as a vulnerability. As a result, countries are pushing for diversification of supply sources or developing domestic capabilities in semiconductor manufacturing. TSMC building in Arizona? This is for security reason. 

In summary, I believe that the recent surge of negative propaganda against Nvidia is nothing more than FUD that overlooks the company’s critical role in today’s tech landscape. Critics might point to emerging technologies like quantum computing or spotlight various competitors, but these alternatives are still a long way from challenging Nvidia’s dominant position. Just look at the trillions of dollars being invested in AI—this massive influx of capital underscores how essential Nvidia’s technology is to the current digital revolution.

We are at a transformative moment in modern history, comparable to the advent of the internet, and Nvidia stands as a linchpin in this evolution. While the full earnings impact of these trends is still unfolding, upcoming reports from AI and semiconductor companies give us a clear glimpse of the robust performance we can expect from Nvidia in its next earnings cycle. Just look at ASML and AVGO's movements.

Nvidia is unique in that it produces a product that every country and company is eager to acquire. Despite this, we continue to see numerous articles claiming that Nvidia has been dethroned. By what, exactly? Is it because of a chatbot like Deepseek—which, in fact, runs on Nvidia’s chips—or is it due to quantum computing, a technology that currently lacks substantial, revenue-generating industrial applications?

The reality is that Nvidia is well-positioned to remain the industry leader for several more years. Moreover, if TSMC completes its Arizona factory as expected in 2025, we could very well see Nvidia achieving record profits once again. Rather than being swayed by unfounded claims, it’s important to recognize that Nvidia’s technological prowess and strategic importance in the AI and semiconductor sectors remain unparalleled."
1ifhrfj,NVDA_Stock,Microsoft Q2 conference Call was a plus for Nvidia,"Good afternoon, I want to share with you some important information provided by Microsoft on the Q2 conference call:

“Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $22.6 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $15.8 billion. More than half of our cloud and AI-related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.

The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals, including our customer-contracted backlog.”

…a few paragraphs later…..

“We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and Q4 to remain at similar levels as our Q2 spend. In FY '26, we expect to continue investing against strong demand signals, including customer contracted backlog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our Microsoft Cloud. However, the growth rate will be lower than FY '25 and the mix of spend will begin to shift back to short-lived assets, which are more correlated to revenue growth”


So in the first paragraph they spent half on the long term assets are PPE (plant,property, and equipment) and the other half on short term assets which are CPU and GPU’s

Then they go on to say they will spend more in 26 than in 25. With more money on GPUs than PPE.

1ifbjzg,NVDA_Stock,10% Tariff on Chips: Best-Case Scenario for NVIDIA?,"I wanted to share some thoughts on the recent developments involving NVIDIA, the 10% tariff on chips, and how platforms like Deepseek might be shifting the landscape. Here’s a quick breakdown:

Tariff Talk: 10% vs. a Full Chip Ban

	•	10% Tariff – The Best-Case Scenario:

Instead of a crippling full-blown chip ban, a 10% tariff is a moderate hurdle. It’s enough to push companies to reexamine their supply chains and maybe boost domestic production without completely severing ties with the global market. NVIDIA, which depends on advanced semiconductor production from around the world, may face some extra costs but nothing that’s utterly disruptive.

	•	What if It Were a Chip Ban?

Imagine a scenario where there was a complete ban on chip imports. The supply chain would be in chaos, production delays would skyrocket, and prices would be insanely volatile. Thankfully, we’re not there—so this 10% tariff is essentially a controlled risk that investors can digest.


Deepseek and the Rise of GPU Rentals

	•	Local & U.S.-Based Cloud Deployments:

Deepseek is proving it can run both locally and on USA cloud services. This is a big deal because it means companies, especially the smaller ones, can access cutting-edge AI and high-performance computing without being too reliant on overseas providers.

	•	Boosting GPU Rentals:

With more companies turning to GPU rentals (powered by NVIDIA) to run these platforms, there’s a bottom-up demand surge. This increased utilization is building a stronger ecosystem for NVIDIA hardware, which in turn drives further innovation and integration in the tech space.


What Does This Mean for NVIDIA in the Next 3 Weeks?

	•	Market Stabilization:

The market seems to have digested the worst-case fears, and the “floor” appears to have been hit. Investors are starting to see the tariff as a manageable cost rather than a catastrophe.

	•	Short-Term Catalyst:

As the GPU rental demand grows and supply chain concerns ease, NVIDIA could see a boost in revenue forecasts and positive analyst sentiment. This might result in some near-term stock gains as traders position themselves for a rebound.

	•	Strategic Resilience:

NVIDIA’s ability to navigate these tariff challenges while capitalizing on new demand dynamics (like those driven by Deepseek) speaks volumes about its strategic positioning. It’s a signal that even under some trade friction, the company is built to adapt and thrive.

TL;DR:

A 10% tariff on chips, while not ideal, is a far better scenario than a full chip ban. With platforms like Deepseek driving up GPU rental demand and solid U.S. cloud/local deployments, NVIDIA could see some positive short-term momentum. The market uncertainty seems to be ebbing, and investors might be looking at a rebound in the coming weeks.


What do you all think about this? Is this a sign of resilience for NVIDIA, or are there other factors we should consider?

1if9m77,NVDA_Stock,Pretty on target this article,"People didn’t like reading the truth but here we are - from Benzinga News wire 94 days ago:  Rump looking to destroy TSMC, NVDA, and all else

11:47 AM EDT, October 29, 2024 (Benzinga Newswire)

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump went after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) for the second time. On the Joe Rogan podcast over the weekend, he accused Taiwan of undermining America's chip industry.

He criticized the U.S. CHIPS Act and pledged to impose tariffs on Taiwanese chips if he wins the presidency, which could significantly affect Taiwan Semi, a major global chip supplier for companies like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), CNBC reports.

Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor dropped 4.3% on Monday following Trump's remarks.

Also Read: TSMC Halts Chip Shipments to China's Sophgo Amid Huawei Connection Investigation

Previously, Trump questioned the U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan, pointing out the absence of a formal defense treaty, unlike agreements with South Korea and Japan.

Nearly every major tech company producing in-house chips, such as Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor.

UBS analysts told CNBC that Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures over 90% of the world's advanced chips.

With rising concerns about Taiwan's geopolitical vulnerability, especially with China, U.S. companies face increasing pressure to build alternative chip production within the U.S.

Taiwan Semiconductor is on the path to receive nearly $7 billion from the U.S. Commerce Department to support its Arizona foundry, with production scaling in 2025.

Trump argued against foreign companies using U.S. government funds for chip plants, calling the CHIPS Act ""a bad deal"" and criticizing funds allocated to wealthy firms.

Analysts at Mizuho warned CNBC that a Trump victory could hurt Taiwan Semiconductor, while Citi analysts told CNBC tariffs could complicate costs across the chip supply chain.

Tariffs against China, as seen under Trump's previous term, could prompt China to retaliate, as it did with Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU).

1if16r5,NVDA_Stock,Why We Must Hold—The Dragon,"It's rough being an NVDA shareholder. Lol juicy gains in almost everything else but Nvidia can't participate. it's truly frustrating because the amount of negative press that goes against NVDA is truly astounding.  It is all the forces of nature just trying to tear Nvidia down.

But with all of that the real ones have to believe. The real ones have to imagine that the FUD and nonsensical media pundits and random bloggers that don't know shit about AI are just willing with all of their might that AI is a bubble, the models aren't getting better, China has defeated the US with a model that was copied from Open AI. Jensen signed breasts. Anything and everything you can imagine holding NVDA is truly a rollercoaster of emotions.

Through all of this, nobody, not a single soul has come out said Jensen ""Thank You"" for ushering in a complete new economy for the past 5 years really. In fact, it's constantly quite the opposite.

Think of it this way. If you could procure IP right now. Any IP in the world that you would want what would it be? For me it would be two distinct things. One of those things I can invest in and the other I can't. Nvidia chip technology and SpaceX technologies. Those are the two most valuable things in the world right now.

We just learned that you can accidently shit out an AI model and compete with the best of them. But nobody can compete with Nvidia and the entire world is trying. The way you may be able to compete is psychological-op Nvidia into the ground. There is an entire fanbase dedicated to this fact.

Someone that commented on one of my posts said this, ""**remember when michael berry (the big short movie guy) put a huge bet on the market crashing in 2023? everyone was like ooooh but he predicted the 2008 crash.**""

The reason why we didn't crash was because of AI. That's the reality of the situation. It energized our nation to build and create many technical achievements because of the AI excitement. Startups and private equity funds sprang up over night because AI AI AI. And, now, only 3.5 short years in we want to tear it all down and say that it's no good. We don't want it anymore. It's a bubble. China can do it for cheaper.

The media refuses to admit that there is a high likelihood that they copied Open AI. That they distilled the model down from other US based models and somehow it doesn't matter because they did it. And it's not just the media it's Google and Microsoft that are promoting this too as a great achievement for China.

This is what is hurting Nvidia. Transparency. For years now things have been promised and have not been delivered or scheduled to be delivered from Open AI. Everyone is stalled nobody is releasing anything that significantly beats out GPT-4. Yes, models do better than OAI on benchmarks this is true but you all know it's meager gains at best. Why is this? Why isn't there anyone who has taken a meaningful leap past GPT-4? Yes R1 great. o3 Amazing.

Is o3 Gpt-5? NO. HELL NO. We all know there is a fire breathing dragon at OAI headquarters. But we the people can't have it. We can't see it. We can't test it. We can't smell it. We just know that it's in there.

Just follow the money. How the hell is Sam Altman getting OAI a $360 Billion valuation without showing that dragon? Am I literally the only one that thinks this? After what just happened with DeepSeek Sam and OAI are going for the BAG and nobody is blinking an eye.

They know some shit. Microsoft knows. Satya knows. They've seen the dragon (GPT-5/Orion). There are people who know what this is and how powerful it is. Why they're not being transparent enough on the model details or the release dates. I don't know. I have a theory though. Microsoft talks about it on every earnings call. We are ""compute constrained."" Specifically Amy Hood said this on this past conference call.

>CFO Amy Hood mentioned that the company is operating from a ""pretty capacity-constrained place,"" attributing this to shortages in power and space.

It's funny because the analyst don't follow up with the next logical question from these statements made by Microsoft. What do you mean you are constrained. What happens when you're not constrained? I don't think it has anything to do with current models. Kind of. Because they deliver API's that anyone can use which is the same for Open AI or Anthropic or Google. There's no constraint for current generation models. We all use this stuff everyday. Again, what do they mean by ""constrained."" I am being rhetorical here but I believe that they mean they have much much larger models that they can't release.

They can't release the dragon. They are GPU constrained. That's what Amy is talking about. Building all of this stuff is time consuming and expensive. Just think about what they *want* for Stargate and this tweet here from Sam.

https://preview.redd.it/oyf548768hge1.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ea2affb40334e211ab58de8266c71219d48702a

That's only 576 GPU's. That's not stargate. That's not even a fraction of what Microsoft and Meta are going to spend on AI in 2025. That's not even anywhere close to Elon Musk's compute cluster with over 100,000 GPUs. But Sam was very thankful for this. I read this as they desperately want to get their hands on the GB200's but can't get them... constrained.

But the deal is and I assume the smart ones among us know is that the close you get to AGI and just wild AI capabilities you obviously will need way more compute. And that compute is going to come from Nvidia. This is why we must hold. The works not done. The models haven't been released or new truly amazing AI capabilities even if they're not from Open AI have yet be released, invented, discovered or perhaps even dreamed of yet.

The show goes on.

Though I wish that Sam would stop the confusion a little and just be upfront with us. Are you capacity and compute constrained on why you can't release these models. This would ease the nonsense against Nvidia. And it's not just Sam to blame for this. Nvidia should be more transparent about this too. And Microsoft too. Explain the road map a little. Explain just how compute constrained everyone is. I think this would do wonders for the share price for both Nvidia and Microsoft. You got no sense but one quote from Satya that there are new models coming soon. Ok we got o3 but what about GPT-5?

Sam just said today regarding GPT-5 not anytime soon but WHY? Just say why. We know why but just say it. This is why we must hold I keep telling myself over and over.

Sam then goes on a Reddit AMA and says this

I don't know how you parse those 2 mixed messages that are each confounding in their own right but let's start with the second post about Humanities last exam. What does soon mean? Soon like this decade? Soon before I die? What does soon mean here? Again, if you have the dragon just sitting in your basement then you may make a comment like this. BUT, going back to the first post you've damn near communicated admitted defeat on X/Twitter.

Soon has to be this year maybe? Right?

I'll take it a step further this type of secrecy, this type of communication is hurting the AI market and thus the AI community. I believe they probably do have something that conquers this test or damn near comes close to it. If they do have something then they should explain it to the world even if you aren't going to release it soon. The 4d / 5d chess move here is that you have millions of dollars of companies now thinking they can go distil down o3 models, package it and call it their own and complain that OAI is lying to everyone and AI really isn't this expensive. All of this communication behavior is adding to the negative media narrative. The haters are always going to have that one thing up their sleave that's true. Show me or it's not real.

So, the question is this. Is the dragon real? When is it coming? Are you compute constrained in a way that is preventing you from releasing many more things like state of the art models? Speak to us like adults and we'll understand. Don't bullshit with it. Otherwise, Elon is correct-You don't have the money. So maybe the dragon doesn't exist but I don't really know. Statements like above from Sam are very confusing and send mixed signals to the market. I say, cut it out and put your cards on the table in a reasonable way.

Your thoughts on this and a critique of my theories would be appreciated because maybe I am the lone soul who feels this way. Until someone proves to me otherwise and some blog post from some guy in his basement from N.Y. isn't going to make me change my mind about the future of what's next and what is going to be. For these reasons, until proven otherwise, this is why we must hold.

RELEASE THE DRAGON

Maybe the Dragon? Update from 10 minutes ago! Sam's up late!

",1738394924.0,Xtianus25,27,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1if16r5/why_we_must_holdthe_dragon/,"Why We Must Hold—The Dragon It's rough being an NVDA shareholder. Lol juicy gains in almost everything else but Nvidia can't participate. it's truly frustrating because the amount of negative press that goes against NVDA is truly astounding.  It is all the forces of nature just trying to tear Nvidia down.

But with all of that the real ones have to believe. The real ones have to imagine that the FUD and nonsensical media pundits and random bloggers that don't know shit about AI are just willing with all of their might that AI is a bubble, the models aren't getting better, China has defeated the US with a model that was copied from Open AI. Jensen signed breasts. Anything and everything you can imagine holding NVDA is truly a rollercoaster of emotions.

Through all of this, nobody, not a single soul has come out said Jensen ""Thank You"" for ushering in a complete new economy for the past 5 years really. In fact, it's constantly quite the opposite.

Think of it this way. If you could procure IP right now. Any IP in the world that you would want what would it be? For me it would be two distinct things. One of those things I can invest in and the other I can't. Nvidia chip technology and SpaceX technologies. Those are the two most valuable things in the world right now.

We just learned that you can accidently shit out an AI model and compete with the best of them. But nobody can compete with Nvidia and the entire world is trying. The way you may be able to compete is psychological-op Nvidia into the ground. There is an entire fanbase dedicated to this fact.

Someone that commented on one of my posts said this, ""**remember when michael berry (the big short movie guy) put a huge bet on the market crashing in 2023? everyone was like ooooh but he predicted the 2008 crash.**""

The reason why we didn't crash was because of AI. That's the reality of the situation. It energized our nation to build and create many technical achievements because of the AI excitement. Startups and private equity funds sprang up over night because AI AI AI. And, now, only 3.5 short years in we want to tear it all down and say that it's no good. We don't want it anymore. It's a bubble. China can do it for cheaper.

The media refuses to admit that there is a high likelihood that they copied Open AI. That they distilled the model down from other US based models and somehow it doesn't matter because they did it. And it's not just the media it's Google and Microsoft that are promoting this too as a great achievement for China.

This is what is hurting Nvidia. Transparency. For years now things have been promised and have not been delivered or scheduled to be delivered from Open AI. Everyone is stalled nobody is releasing anything that significantly beats out GPT-4. Yes, models do better than OAI on benchmarks this is true but you all know it's meager gains at best. Why is this? Why isn't there anyone who has taken a meaningful leap past GPT-4? Yes R1 great. o3 Amazing.

Is o3 Gpt-5? NO. HELL NO. We all know there is a fire breathing dragon at OAI headquarters. But we the people can't have it. We can't see it. We can't test it. We can't smell it. We just know that it's in there.

Just follow the money. How the hell is Sam Altman getting OAI a $360 Billion valuation without showing that dragon? Am I literally the only one that thinks this? After what just happened with DeepSeek Sam and OAI are going for the BAG and nobody is blinking an eye.

They know some shit. Microsoft knows. Satya knows. They've seen the dragon (GPT-5/Orion). There are people who know what this is and how powerful it is. Why they're not being transparent enough on the model details or the release dates. I don't know. I have a theory though. Microsoft talks about it on every earnings call. We are ""compute constrained."" Specifically Amy Hood said this on this past conference call.

>CFO Amy Hood mentioned that the company is operating from a ""pretty capacity-constrained place,"" attributing this to shortages in power and space.

It's funny because the analyst don't follow up with the next logical question from these statements made by Microsoft. What do you mean you are constrained. What happens when you're not constrained? I don't think it has anything to do with current models. Kind of. Because they deliver API's that anyone can use which is the same for Open AI or Anthropic or Google. There's no constraint for current generation models. We all use this stuff everyday. Again, what do they mean by ""constrained."" I am being rhetorical here but I believe that they mean they have much much larger models that they can't release.

They can't release the dragon. They are GPU constrained. That's what Amy is talking about. Building all of this stuff is time consuming and expensive. Just think about what they *want* for Stargate and this tweet here from Sam.

https://preview.redd.it/oyf548768hge1.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ea2affb40334e211ab58de8266c71219d48702a

That's only 576 GPU's. That's not stargate. That's not even a fraction of what Microsoft and Meta are going to spend on AI in 2025. That's not even anywhere close to Elon Musk's compute cluster with over 100,000 GPUs. But Sam was very thankful for this. I read this as they desperately want to get their hands on the GB200's but can't get them... constrained.

But the deal is and I assume the smart ones among us know is that the close you get to AGI and just wild AI capabilities you obviously will need way more compute. And that compute is going to come from Nvidia. This is why we must hold. The works not done.

🔗 Official Announcement

https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/deepseek-r1-nim-microservice/

Why This is a Game-Changer

🔹 DeepSeek-R1 is the largest open LLM—outpacing Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.

🔹 Advanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture enhances reasoning and efficiency.

🔹 128K token context length—far surpassing GPT-4’s capabilities.

🔹 3,872 tokens per second on an NVIDIA HGX H200 system—fully optimized for NVIDIA hardware.

Strategic Implications for NVIDIA

💰 Beyond GPUs—NVIDIA is now an AI platform provider.

💰 DeepSeek-R1 is pre-optimized for NVIDIA hardware, giving them a significant first-mover advantage.

💰 Enterprise AI adoption will be NVIDIA-native—from hardware to AI models, creating a fully integrated AI ecosystem.

💰 AI data centers will now be built around NVIDIA solutions, reinforcing their dominance.

1idcut1,NVDA_Stock,"No, Nvidia Isn't Doomed: Microsoft’s Capex Plans","Just a heads-up before you hear any noise or confusion in the media making doomsday predictions about Nvidia.

Today, Microsoft’s CFO mentioned on the earnings call that their capex growth rate for FY2026 will be lower than FY2025. That does NOT mean capex is shrinking—just that the rate of growth is slowing, which makes sense given that FY2025 already has a massive $80B capex. It wouldn’t be reasonable to expect an even higher growth rate from that baseline.

More importantly, the CFO also said they’ll be shifting more capex towards CPUs and GPUs. Right now, capex includes things like land and buildings, but going forward, more money will be spent on CPUs and GPUs—great news for Nvidia!



**Amy E. Hood** \-- *Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer*

And maybe, Karl, just to reiterate a little of the comments that I made on capex because I think it's helpful to ground a bit more in what Satya is saying, a fungible fleet means. We have, and I think we talked about it, close to $300 billion of RPO. That is committed customer contracts that need to be delivered on. And the faster we can do that and the more efficiently we can do that, the better off we are, not just the OpenAI partnership, which is a piece of that, but with the entire platform that we need to deliver for our customers.

And I think the other thing that's sometimes missing is when we say fungible, we mean not just the primary use, which we've always talked about, which is inference. But there is some training post training, which is a key component. And then they're just running the commercial cloud, which at every layer under every modern AI app that's going to be built will be required. It will be required to be distributed, and it will be required to be global.

And all of those things are really important because it then means you're the most efficient. **And so, the investment you see us make in capex, you're right, the front end has been this sort of infrastructure build that lets us really catch up not just on the AI infrastructure we needed, but think about that as the building itself, data centers, but also some of the catch-up we need to do on the commercial cloud side.** **And then you'll see the pivot to more CPU and GPU**. And that pivot will more directly correlate to revenue, and it will be contracted either with the partnership that you asked about with OpenAI or with others.

And so, I do think the way I want everyone to internalize it is that the capex growth is going through that cycle pivot, which is far more correlated to customer contract delivery, no matter who the end customer is.",1738206834.0,Remote_Rise_5466,94,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1idcut1/no_nvidia_isnt_doomed_microsofts_capex_plans/,"No, Nvidia Isn't Doomed: Microsoft’s Capex Plans Just a heads-up before you hear any noise or confusion in the media making doomsday predictions about Nvidia.

1id9dkk,NVDA_Stock,"NVDA: Microsoft's Q2 2025 Call: Satya Nadella - ""New Models Coming Soon!"" - We can't go into the future without increased model capabilities and progression - BULLISH!","On the Q2 call, as an NVDA shareholder and MSFT, that is the most and only important thing that was said.

If the models don't improve by a larger factor then the slowdown will start to begin for NVDA but for software it will heavily rise because workloads will permeate more through the development phase, POC phase and ultimately the production use case phase.

The only other notable news on the MSFT call relating to NVDA was a question from Karl Kirstad from UBS.

**UBS**: Stargate news and the announced changes in the OAI relationship last weeks. Investors interpreted this as MSFT taking more of a backseat while remaining very committed for OAI's success. I was hoping you would frame your strategic decisions around Stargate and CapEx needs over the next several years.

**Satya**, We remain very committed to OAI. Their Success is our Success that commensurate that announcement. We are building a pretty fungible fleet of AI servers with the right balance between training and inference. Software optimizations not just from what DS has done. We have done a lot of work done to reduce the price of GPT models with OAI over the years. You can't just launch the frontier model - if it's too expensive to serve it's not good. You got to have that optimization so that inferencing costs are coming down and they can be consumed broadly.

So that's the fleet physics we're managing. And remember, you don't want to buy too much of anything at one time because the Moore's law every year (GPU) is going to give you 2x, Optimizations are going to give you 10X. You want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize the fleet, age the fleet, and at the end of the day have the right ratio of monetization to what you think of as the training expense. I feel very good about the investment we're making and it's fungible and it allows us to scale more long term business.

**My interpretations and a caveat**: I'll start with the caveat. Open AI is still the King but there is a hard convergence of potential competition really gaining a full head of steam. The caveat very directly is this. Open AI has to launch the next damn models. The models need to become better and more accurate. PERIOD. There's still heavy value in that. And this is something nobody talks about but is extremely important.

If you stopped creating any new models today AI would eventually fail. However, there would be much more work loads built from the AI that exists currently today. Still, if you never created another model the entire AI industry would stall. It would freeze and we would go through another long period of an AI winter.

The issue for me is that we haven't seen much progress in models beyond GPT-4. That's just a fact. There is 4o a 4 derivative and there is o1 which is still to me a 4 derivative. Now, there is Anthropic, Meta (Llama) and DeepSeek V3/R1). All of these models are derivatives of GPT-4. People can parse test benchmarks that this model scored 91% and this other models scored 90% and this other model scored 86.5689%. It doesn't matter there entire space is stalled currently at GPT-4.

For an NVDA shareholder this is the thing that matters. Gaining efficiencies in a not super great model but just good enough as it was for the past 1.5 years now is not some great accomplishment.

I'll give you a direct example of what I mean. DeepSeek, as I said is a pretty good o1 clone, it is. However they got there who cares at this point. That being said, it's incredibly slow compared to GPT's o1. In this way you can't make a strong argument that hardware doesn't matter when the DeepSeek model can barely handle any load.  For o1, whilst it's faster it's very limited in it's usage. 50 messages per week is an extreme limitation. If you can optimize that with DeepSeek's supposed optimizations and let's say they were 50% true or worth doing that would be a huge improvement over an o1 type model. So absolutely that type of optimization would be very very useful.

BUT, to me, that takes a back seat to actually improving the models function and accuracy and capabilities. Right? Ask yourself if it's slow but better does anybody care? I know you can speed things up eventually with Moore's Law (GPU's) and Optimizations. I know you can do that. What I don't know is can you make the models better? Can you drastically improve the models?

I believe the answer to that is still YES. I don't believe that we have stalled. I just don't believe that. However, I do believe that compute is very very constrained and to unlock the new large models we need desperately optimizations and compute.

Regardless of DeepSeek being real or truthful or not, we will now be on a mission of optimizations and increased model capabilities from here on out. The race for AI supremacy has truly begun. For the first time Open AI has their backs against the wall. They have to put up or risk being not #1. I still feel they have things in their back pocket and they're #1 but that is under threat. Again, DeepSeek didn't product a more accurate model because it's all derived by GPT but they may have produced a much more efficient model and thus this is a benefit to the entire AI industry.

For NVDA, you and I are hoping/praying/wishing that Open AI comes out with a very powerful and way better new AI model. That is what will drive server GPU sells. Efficiencies are beyond welcome. Capabilities are what is desired.

We need new better models that are much better than Dalle-3. Better than Sora 1, Better than SearchGPT. Better than o1 and or o3. Better thank DeepSeek R1. Better than Llama 4. Better than Claude 4. We need vision capabilities that start performing at human eye resolution levels of accuracy so that we can truly usher in things like self driving cars and robotics. Military applications and capabilities will increasingly need AI and AI platforms like PLTR. Medical research and discoveries will need more and better AI than we can even imagine.

All of these things will become easier to build and create with increased model capabilities and emerging intelligences. We still have so long to go it will be 10 years before we can even imagine all of this slowing down.

Because I know this to be true, I am still very bullish on Nvidia. Yes, optimizations are necessary but the commodity of GPU servers and Moore's Law is still more important than ever. Bluntly, the data scientist have to put more intelligence into more compute and into more server builds. The build out of that is still years into the making.

We are just getting started and frankly, the kick in the ASS China just gave will serve to accelerate all of this faster and further than we could of imagined.",1738197191.0,Xtianus25,67,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1id9dkk/nvda_microsofts_q2_2025_call_satya_nadella_new/,"NVDA: Microsoft's Q2 2025 Call: Satya Nadella - ""New Models Coming Soon!"" - We can't go into the future without increased model capabilities and progression - BULLISH!

For NVDA, you and I are hoping/praying/wishing that Open AI comes out with a very powerful and way better new AI model. That is what will drive server GPU sells. Efficiencies are beyond welcome. Capabilities are what is desired.

We need new better models that are much better than Dalle-3. Better than Sora 1, Better than SearchGPT. Better than o1 and or o3. Better thank DeepSeek R1. Better than Llama 4. Better than Claude 4. We need vision capabilities that start performing at human eye resolution levels of accuracy so that we can truly usher in things like self driving cars and robotics. Military applications and capabilities will increasingly need AI and AI platforms like PLTR. Medical research and discoveries will need more and better AI than we can even imagine.

All of these things will become easier to build and create with increased model capabilities and emerging intelligences. We still have so long to go it will be 10 years before we can even imagine all of this slowing down.

Because I know this to be true, I am still very bullish on Nvidia. Yes, optimizations are necessary but the commodity of GPU servers and Moore's Law is still more important than ever. Bluntly, the data scientist have to put more intelligence into more compute and into more server builds. The build out of that is still years into the making.

We are just getting started and frankly, the kick in the ASS China just gave will serve to accelerate all of this faster and further than we could of imagined."

If you ever thought fund managers were “smart” this should be your proof that they aren’t. Just dumb sheep like everyone else despite what they make it seem. Though I’m certain there is a handful sharp few who are playing the move to their advantage 

All this shows is how skiddish and weak handed everyone got over nothing. Deepseek had some improvement that is interesting but how people interpreted what they did in the way that they did was absolutely bizarre

1icsp40,NVDA_Stock,NVDA DD: Data-Driven Evaluation,"Hi Everybody,

Seeming this much noise on the forums, I decided to make my own analysis based on actual data. Hopefully it will start some meaningful conversation here, and switch from ""NVDA to the moon"" style to actual conversations. :)

   * Leveraging the CUDA platform.
   * Autonomous Driving boom

# 4️⃣ Recent news I found important

* DeepSeek and other efficient LLM-s are launched
* Trump administration is preparing a lot of tariffs to protect US economy ""advantage""
* Stargate project with a total of $500 billion got announced
* RTX series is launched to gain bigger portion of gaming market
* FED will not cut interest rate yet!
* AI use-cases are getting developed for automotive and pharma industry
* Military spending will increase globally as Trump administration expects NATO members to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense and the reality is that smart systems that help coordination are critical in such use-cases.

# 5️⃣ The good news

* Nvidia has a great advantage on the market. It started way earlier than other competition to push for Research and Development. Such know-how is hard to beat in short-term (2-3 years).
* Nvidia has the CUDA system which became a tactical weapon of such we can see at Apple. Even if the hardware is weaker, the software developed directly on it is closing the gap.
* There is no need to panic due to an LLM model that is efficient. Yet, it is just a model that can answer questions in an efficient manner. I would like to use the same phrase what I have seen recently in the comments: If you buy a calculator that is 10x cheaper but it is sometimes wrong, then you have basically a wrong calculator and you have to buy another one. What I want to say with this is that the use-cases must be built upon it and they must make it way more accurate for commercial use. In this process a lot of computing power might be needed, and you might end up at OpenAI level. Anyhow, we cannot ignore the fact that only a few companies have their final AI ecosystem yet, so I would not worry that we won't need GPU-s anymore. I would rather say the contrary! Microsoft has already realized it. If they want to provide to customers Cloud-based AI then they have to have the capacity to do so. For such reasons the Microsoft stock is struggling at a price level, however we can say that they will grow massively due to their quick adoption.
* Stargate project is released. From the $500 billion in the next 4 years we can estimate 20-25% going to Nvidia, which would potentially mean $25 billion a year in their revenue. Lately, such amount was their quarterly revenue. Soon, they might have a very strong revenue increase from this!
* The new RTX series GPU-s are a let down in raw power, but DLSS4 technology brings an ease to poorly optimized games and a great boost for previous generations of GPU-s. My feelings are mixed regarding this too, but for the game developers a lot of time is needed to move from one infrastructure to another. The newest game engines are super expensive and the ongoing developments from 2022 for example cannot be pushed to a new platform just like that. My expectation is that the newest games will get a huge boost from the engine side too that can work with DLSS technology.
* FED rate cut is inevitable and announced already. Up until that point my recommendation is to continue investing into good deals to fully benefit from the rate cut.
* There are many articles around the ARM system adoption and how much benefits are out there to use it in regards of performance. Not to mention that there are news out there announcing that Nvidia will come out with a CPU itself which will integrate well into this ecosystem. (RIP AMD and Intel)

# 6️⃣ The bad news

* The market is simply irrational and overreacting everything. In such scenario there is a lot of volatility up-and-down. As Nvidia became the biggest company in the world the upside is really limited without actual results. So be ready for sudden downturns.
* There are a lot of speculative moves out there and people are taking a lot of risk to benefit from 5-10% increase where they sell a lot of their shares.
* Unfortunately, the tariffs on the US market are a huge burden for growth, however its implications are not quantified by anybody yet. What we can say: The pipeline for Nvidia is full for the upcoming years, and even if a few customers are lost, there are still institutions in the line to buy their products.
* A lot of Nvidia employees with good know-how might not be in the company anymore, which slows down R&D efforts and this is helping other countries to analyze Nvidia products are replicate their performance. This is not necessarily bringing them to the front, but Nvidia might lost its bargaining power.

# 7️⃣ Final Thoughts and data driven forecasting

The P/E of Nvidia was 50-55 in the last period, so people wanted to give more dollars for one dollar of earnings. For companies with such a huge market cap roughly 30-50 P/E is realistic. This is bad news though, because if we look at Nvidia with such mentality then the current price would be around $100.

The good news is that the investors are not P/E maniacs and they are fine with the current higher price level if the growth is justifying it. For such, a good indicator is PEG. This indicator is telling you using the P/E and EPS growth rate if you could expect growth from the company (earnings per share-wise) in the next year or not. E.g.: The P/E is 50, but the PEG is 1 then you can be sure that the last year this company didn't grow much and probably it won't. In case of Nvidia: Looking at the post-dip values, the PEG is 0.2 right now. What this is telling us? The people do not expect the same growth (200%+) this year which is fine, however they do not expect the half of it as well. In such cases be critical and follow the news to stay updated. The Nvidia blackwell product-line just got launched, which is a significant leap in performance and pricing. Underestimating the need for such chipset would be foolish. Hence, we can be sure that the revenue forecast will be beaten again. My personal expectation is that they end up around 40-41 BN revenue contrary to the \~38 BN forecast.

I have made some simple calculations for the upcoming period and please feel free to debate it or agree with it.

1ickfaf,NVDA_Stock,3 Key Take Aways from Stacy Rasgon on DeepSeek & the Nvidia Sell-Off,"Basically he's still very bullish on Nvidia. His 3 key takeaways from this past weekend's news were:

1. He highly doubts the claim DeepSeek was trained for only $5 million. That's just ridiculous.

2. The types of things the DeepSeek team did was not some kind of miracle. Multi-headed attention and lower precision calculations are not new ideas. Labs around the world have already been working on these techniques. There is nothing new or groundbreaking here.

3. The Monday sell off was an overblown panic. We don't know what DeepSeek is spending on their reasoning model, but it's probably more than what it cost to train the base model. 

But cost reduction is actually a good thing for semiconductor demand. For 50 years straight, cost fell by a factor of 2 every year and it was a fantastic thing for semiconductor demand. In fact, he says we need these kinds of efficiencies and innovations or else no one will be able to advance forward to where they need to be.

Stacy says the case to be made is that the more efficient things get, the more demand will go up. So he sees this all as a good thing.

The host pushed back and argued the case that Nvidia's been rewarded so far based on the idea that it is ""the best"" and has a moat built around being ""exclusive"". Stacy pushed back on that saying everyone is still going to need to buy a lot of chips anyway and that its really the people selling the AI models, not the chips, that is the real commodity here. Everyone is selling their AI Models to the general public and they will still need to buy a lot of chips to make those products better. And in just last week alone, multiple big investment announcements were made: Facebook/Meta announced that it was going to massively increase their CapEx guide, then the $500B Stargate project, and China announced a $140B AI investment.

The host asked about Blackwell being a problem, and if Nvidia in their press statement today, is admitting out loud that you don't need the latest, greatest, most expensive chip based on what DeepSeek has been able to do?

Stacy disagreed and cited Jevon's Paradox, and the world has never ever had a enough compute. He told a story about going to a semiconductor conference a few years ago and hearing a Nvidia's chief scientist give a keynote speech saying that GPU performance in the prior 10 years has improved by 1000x and over the next ten years performance would improve by over a million x.

2. The types of things the DeepSeek team did was not some kind of miracle. Multi-headed attention and lower precision calculations are not new ideas. Labs around the world have already been working on these techniques. There is nothing new or groundbreaking here.

3. The Monday sell off was an overblown panic. We don't know what DeepSeek is spending on their reasoning model, but it's probably more than what it cost to train the base model. 

But cost reduction is actually a good thing for semiconductor demand. For 50 years straight, cost fell by a factor of 2 every year and it was a fantastic thing for semiconductor demand. In fact, he says we need these kinds of efficiencies and innovations or else no one will be able to advance forward to where they need to be.

Stacy says the case to be made is that the more efficient things get, the more demand will go up. So he sees this all as a good thing.

The host pushed back and argued the case that Nvidia's been rewarded so far based on the idea that it is ""the best"" and has a moat built around being ""exclusive"". Stacy pushed back on that saying everyone is still going to need to buy a lot of chips anyway and that its really the people selling the AI models, not the chips, that is the real commodity here. Everyone is selling their AI Models to the general public and they will still need to buy a lot of chips to make those products better. And in just last week alone, multiple big investment announcements were made: Facebook/Meta announced that it was going to massively increase their CapEx guide, then the $500B Stargate project, and China announced a $140B AI investment.

The host asked about Blackwell being a problem, and if Nvidia in their press statement today, is admitting out loud that you don't need the latest, greatest, most expensive chip based on what DeepSeek has been able to do?

Stacy disagreed and cited Jevon's Paradox, and the world has never ever had a enough compute. He told a story about going to a semiconductor conference a few years ago and hearing a Nvidia's chief scientist give a keynote speech saying that GPU performance in the prior 10 years has improved by 1000x and over the next ten years performance would improve by over a million x.

1iccvz8,NVDA_Stock,Anecdotal experience on why DeepSeek is good for NVDA,"This is just one use case, but it's easy to extrapolate to any number of other fields.

First some background: I used to program a long time ago, but mostly managed development projects for decades, then not at all. I can't write a single line of useful code with todays' languages, frameworks, or tools.

My company needed a website b2b portal, which was quoted at 2 months and $10k+. I had some spare time, so I decided to give it a try with an OpenAI pro account that costs $200.

Week 1: Finished half the spec. Whoa, amazing that I'm developing an app without knowing what I'm doing.

Week 2: Finished the entire spec... actually exceeded specifications. Jeez, this is incredible.

Week 3: Added enterprise features beyond the spec, while using AI to set up docker, git, local and remote configs, etc. Woohoo, I rock (or feels like it)!

Week 4: Continuing for fun. Still can't type a line of useful code if my life depended on it. But this portal is pretty cool!

ChatGPT estimates the current project would take 9 months for a good dev to complete. From my experience, that's not far off but let's call it 5 months with testing, coordination, and specs. $40k cost without AI is very conservative.

A business that saves $30k in a month does not care if OpenAI pro is $20 or $200. What matters is if AI is smarter, saving an extra day or week.

DeepSeek showed that AI compute can be 10x cheaper. That means future models can use the extra compute to become smarter. No AI provider will scale back on NVDA just because compute costs less, and no business will settle for a less productive model to save a couple hundred $ when they're paying employees thousands.   
  
Furthermore, the applications for smarter models increases exponentially. The cost savings are just too good for companies to pass up.

Some of the comments that caught my attention were attempts to make arguments using logical fallacies, such as *appeal to hypocrisy*, *equivocation*, and others. Rather than diving into each individual comment to dispute it—because, let’s be honest, how often does anyone actually succeed in changing someone’s opinion on the internet—I’d like to take a different approach. Instead, for your entertainment, I propose taking a retrospective look at some of China's past ""breakthroughs"" in technology and sharing my perspective on them.

The *too long, didn’t read (TL;DR)* version of this post is that history has shown us, time and time again, that Chinese companies' so-called ""innovations"" should often be viewed with skepticism. Over the past two decades, technological breakthroughs touted as revolutionary—sometimes even hyped as the harbingers of the end of Western, particularly American, dominance in tech—have frequently been revealed as fraudulent. In many cases, these ""innovations"" led to sanctions by the global community for intellectual property theft.

Today’s dip in the technology market has prompted me to ask, ""Really? Are we supposed to believe that a small Chinese company managed to outpace, by a significant margin, the world's leading engineers and scientists working for multi-trillion-dollar companies?"" Let’s not forget that America, renowned for developing and attracting the best minds worldwide for over a century, somehow allegedly missed this one small company and its groundbreaking innovation. Maybe I’m wrong, but when something sounds this extraordinary, shouldn’t we scrutinize it carefully rather than rushing to accept it as fact?

As an example, I conducted a simple test—just like others on this subreddit—and noticed clear data biases in *DeepSeek*. The bias was glaring, yet I saw people praising it for being “transparent.” To be fair, I don’t have the technical expertise to conduct an in-depth validation of DeepSeek. However, what I *do* have is a clear memory of China's track record when it comes to technological “breakthroughs.”

For this post, I’ll walk you through some of these past examples—from the most recent cases to older ones—as far back as time allows. Let’s take a closer look and assess whether these patterns offer any lessons about how we should view such claims in the present.

Do we want to just forget about the recent Scientific Paper Mills? In its greed to rush for global dominance, the Chinese Communist Party has been implicated in large-scale scientific fraud. Investigations revealed the existence of ""paper mills"" that produce fraudulent scientific papers to inflate academic credentials and research achievements. This practice has led to concerns about the integrity of scientific research emerging from China.

In 2003, Chen Jin, a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, announced the development of the ""Hanxin"" (Chinese for ""Chinese chip""), which was celebrated as a significant advancement in digital signal processing. However, in early 2006, investigations revealed that Chen had fraudulently presented foreign chips as his own creation by removing their original markings. This deception led to his dismissal and highlighted the pressures within China's research community to achieve rapid technological advancements.

Lastly, let’s not forget how Huawei was once hailed as the ""Apple and Samsung killer."" With slogans like ""It’s my way or the Huawei,"" the company was positioned as a tech giant poised to dominate the global smartphone market. However, after being caught and sanctioned for IP theft, Huawei’s trajectory drastically changed. Since then, they haven’t been able to produce a single phone that can truly compete with the likes of Apple or Samsung.

As for BYD, the jury is still out. But the main point I’m making here is that DeepSeek might be another scam. It’s hard to believe that the top talent at leading global companies—people who are responsible for investing trillions into AI hardware—could all be so misguided, especially if DeepSeek can supposedly achieve the same results at a fraction of the cost. That just doesn’t align with what we know about innovation. Breakthroughs, particularly in AI, don’t come cheap. The claims surrounding DeepSeek remind me of cold fusion—a revolutionary idea that sounded too good to be true and ultimately wasn’t.

Coming from a science and healthcare background, I can’t help but approach these announcements with skepticism, especially after the recent exposure of China’s ""scientific paper mill"" scandals. These operations produced fraudulent research on a massive scale, undermining trust in scientific breakthroughs from the region. Revolutionary claims like those from DeepSeek demand scrutiny, particularly when we’re still in the infancy of AI development.

For the past 100 years, the United States has been the undisputed global leader in technological innovation. This dominance stems from consistent investment in research and development (R&D), a robust education system, strong intellectual property protections, and its ability to attract and nurture top talent from around the world. These foundational elements are critical to meaningful innovation, and they take time, resources, and expertise to cultivate.

This is just my opinion, but I believe history will once again show us whether this so-called breakthrough from DeepSeek is legitimate or just another in a long line of overhyped claims from the past two decades. Only time will tell, but for now, skepticism is warranted.",1738030838.0,Rainyfriedtofu,37,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1ibr4eg/a_retrospective_of_chinas_breakthroughs_over_the/,"A retrospective of China's ""Breakthroughs"" over the past decade Hello NVDA people,

The bias was glaring, yet I saw people praising it for being “transparent.” To be fair, I don’t have the technical expertise to conduct an in-depth validation of DeepSeek. However, what I *do* have is a clear memory of China's track record when it comes to technological “breakthroughs.”

For this post, I’ll walk you through some of these past examples—from the most recent cases to older ones—as far back as time allows. Let’s take a closer look and assess whether these patterns offer any lessons about how we should view such claims in the present.

Do you guys remember Beijing Zuojiang Technology? it was once considered a company that had the potential to rival Nvidia. I got delisted back in July 2024 for financial fraud and basically laying about its capacity to do work.

Dongfang Jingyuan Electron Limited, founded by former ASML employee Yu Zongchang, this company, along with its U.S. counterpart Xtal, was implicated in stealing confidential data from ASML, a leading Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer.

Do we want to just forget about the recent Scientific Paper Mills? In its greed to rush for global dominance, the Chinese Communist Party has been implicated in large-scale scientific fraud. Investigations revealed the existence of ""paper mills"" that produce fraudulent scientific papers to inflate academic credentials and research achievements. This practice has led to concerns about the integrity of scientific research emerging from China.

In 2003, Chen Jin, a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, announced the development of the ""Hanxin"" (Chinese for ""Chinese chip""), which was celebrated as a significant advancement in digital signal processing. However, in early 2006, investigations revealed that Chen had fraudulently presented foreign chips as his own creation by removing their original markings. This deception led to his dismissal and highlighted the pressures within China's research community to achieve rapid technological advancements.

Lastly, let’s not forget how Huawei was once hailed as the ""Apple and Samsung killer."" With slogans like ""It’s my way or the Huawei,"" the company was positioned as a tech giant poised to dominate the global smartphone market. However, after being caught and sanctioned for IP theft, Huawei’s trajectory drastically changed. Since then, they haven’t been able to produce a single phone that can truly compete with the likes of Apple or Samsung.

As for BYD, the jury is still out. But the main point I’m making here is that DeepSeek might be another scam. It’s hard to believe that the top talent at leading global companies—people who are responsible for investing trillions into AI hardware—could all be so misguided, especially if DeepSeek can supposedly achieve the same results at a fraction of the cost. That just doesn’t align with what we know about innovation. Breakthroughs, particularly in AI, don’t come cheap. The claims surrounding DeepSeek remind me of cold fusion—a revolutionary idea that sounded too good to be true and ultimately wasn’t.

Coming from a science and healthcare background, I can’t help but approach these announcements with skepticism, especially after the recent exposure of China’s ""scientific paper mill"" scandals. These operations produced fraudulent research on a massive scale, undermining trust in scientific breakthroughs from the region. Revolutionary claims like those from DeepSeek demand scrutiny, particularly when we’re still in the infancy of AI development.

For the past 100 years, the United States has been the undisputed global leader in technological innovation. This dominance stems from consistent investment in research and development (R&D), a robust education system, strong intellectual property protections, and its ability to attract and nurture top talent from around the world. These foundational elements are critical to meaningful innovation, and they take time, resources, and expertise to cultivate.

This is just my opinion, but I believe history will once again show us whether this so-called breakthrough from DeepSeek is legitimate or just another in a long line of overhyped claims from the past two decades. Only time will tell, but for now, skepticism is warranted."

1ibpnad,NVDA_Stock,Why I am still with NVDA,"Based on what we have seen in the last couple of days, I won't blame anyone if they are genuinely worried that  NVIDIA’s business might be at risk. We are learning how DeepSeek’s approach could make training incredibly more efficient. But honestly, this kind of narrative feels more like a misunderstanding of how this industry works and where the demand for GPUs is heading. NVIDIA isn’t just about selling hardware for one specific task – it’s about enabling a whole ecosystem of possibilities.

Let’s talk about what happens if training processes become much more efficient. Sure, less GPU time might be needed for a single training run. But what does that really free up? For starters, it allows researchers and companies to push boundaries they couldn’t before. They can train larger models or experiment with more complex architectures, something that’s been limited by compute budgets. The hunger for better AI doesn’t stop just because one process gets optimized. If anything, it grows.

And that’s just one angle. The extra horsepower can also be redirected to real-time applications. Think autonomous driving, robotics, or even personalized AI systems that run locally instead of on the cloud. These areas are still scratching the surface of what’s possible, and having more GPU power readily available can only accelerate progress. NVIDIA isn’t stuck in one lane—they’re powering the infrastructure for all of these.

On top of that, let’s not forget about AI’s role in fields like drug discovery or physics simulations. These aren’t short-term trends; they’re long-term revolutions that need incredible amounts of compute. The efficiencies might just mean these projects get done faster or allow for even deeper exploration. Again, NVIDIA’s hardware and software stack are front and center in these advancements.

There’s also the fact that efficiency doesn’t necessarily mean less overall demand. If anything, it’s a chance to broaden the reach of AI. Lower costs could make advanced training accessible to smaller companies or even individual researchers who couldn’t afford it before. More players in the space mean more GPUs in use. Simple as that.

And finally, it’s not just about AI. Gaming, cloud computing, content creation, and other industries are growing alongside AI—and NVIDIA’s footprint is everywhere. The efficiency improvements in one domain don’t mean the end of demand; they’re more like a redistribution or even a multiplier for growth in other areas.

TLDR: NVIDIA’s business isn’t crumbling because of advancements like these. If anything, they’re in a position to benefit from them. When the need for compute grows, so does the opportunity for the company providing it. And NVIDIA is still miles ahead when it comes to meeting that need.

1ibp25t,NVDA_Stock,Need for less compute or cheaper compute doesn't make NVDA less valuable - quite the opposite,"Nvidia themselves have been making their compute dramatically cheap over time. I mean look at this log scale graph: https://epoch.ai/blog/trends-in-gpu-price-performance. It shows an exponential drop in price for the same unit compute and it's been pretty consistent since they started out as a company.

If cheaper compute or need for less compute (same thing) was a bad thing for NVDA, they would be done by now as people would need to spend way less to achieve their goals. And NVDA wouldn't be innovating as fast as they are, trying to make their own offering exponentially cheaper each year and digging their own grave in the process.

Why hasn't that happened?

Instead, it's only reignited the need for exponentially more compute as new tech, use cases and adoption gets enabled. Ordinary folks or wall street thinks that the need for compute is some fixed quantity or has an upper limit. It hasn't happened in the last 50 years, it's not going to happen now, especially with the transition from algorithms to compute hungry models.

This Deepseek training cost calibration, even if true, is a blip in the continued trajectory in the never ending need for more compute. If anything, the need for compute trajectory has now hit an exponential curve because previous innovation in tech wasn't that compute hungry.

Additionally, Deepseek's statements on costs are misleading. See here for a much more detailed analysis: https://www.interconnects.ai/p/deepseek-v3-and-the-actual-cost-of. It's like saying my trip to LA only cost me $300 because I rented a car for 4 days. And not to mention other costs associated with any trip.

Post-query LLM RL processing is still in its infancy!,"I look outside and the sky is still blue and hasn't fallen even though CNBC, Meta's Yann LeCun, and Perplexity would have you believe otherwise. 

It will take time, weeks if not months to properly vet what the DeepSeek paper means. I want to be clear All of their weights including bias and other tunings are not present in their hugging face or github repo. I am not backing down from that. What is also not there is any (0) of the data used or training methods used to even begin to know if their magical unicorn poop story of we built a model at a 98% discount is based in any reality. We don't know if they overfitted the model for benchmarks. What we immediately see is that there is CCP China propaganda suppression directly embedded in the model.  

One thing I am clear on is that there was a lot of US data that was used and more than probable usage of US lab frontier models that were used in the creation and making of DeepSeek. It thinks it's GPT-4 and that is not for some accidental reason. It was trained heavily if not entirely on US frontier models. 

Side note, if the U.S. government wanted to ban tik tok how in the world is this not an even great threat? 

But none of that matters. Let's take China for their word and presume that they did exactly what it is that their saying. Let's imagine for a moment that OpenAI or Nvidia came out with the exact same information about efficiency gains would this not be great news? 

If you can train less and inference more isn't that a massive win? 

Jim Fan is a Senior Research Scientist at NVIDIA and had this to say. 

https://preview.redd.it/a8223vwi5lfe1.png?width=829&format=png&auto=webp&s=e34dceffe8282212b3fa6c4cfe9bda3df106e2e1

The o3 model and it's ability to reason and think is light years away from anything that deepseek released. Did they do some version of COT reasoning steps yes you can see it but it's a light hearted copy version of what GPT-o1 is doing today. Literally, it spills out some COT's and resolves to an answer. Is that auto-COT on the same level of o1 or the upcoming o3? I know for a fact that is not the case. 

Still, model training is a portion of what goes on in AI. What you and I see and use has nothing to do with training as we are at the receiving end of inferencing.  We consume the final result of a trained model and with o1-oX it will be that the models effectively go through a  reasoning thought process and relay inferencing back and forth. This isn't some recipe for less compute in the very beginning but rather much more compute. That's what Jim Fan is speaking to. 

The DeepSeek paper will be vetted by our brightest and most accomplished data scientists so I think the world should wait to find out more of what exactly was noteworthy from the accomplishments of that paper, if any. Again, for me, starting with someone else's data and model is quite the shortcut. 

Another issue I have with all of this is NOBODY. No lab, no mater opensource or closes source has effectively beat GPT-4. We are all still using GPT-4. So, I think it is fair to wonder and ask OpenAI where is the next models. Are they going to just drip out models at a very slow pace OR does this give them motivation to go faster and further with less concern about certain safety aspects. 

Again, Jim Fan addressed this clearly. 

https://preview.redd.it/pgq7thnr7lfe1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d40ece46c6235246a1a03db6f1406e2617b4f9

That is a shot in the arm and a wake up call to closed end labs who are developing AI/AGI/ASI. You can't just stand there and horde everything AI whilst at the same time not coming out with another frontier model for over 3 years now. That's a direct shot at that slow roll process. Simply, the world isn't go into a safety bubble and wait from 1 or 3 players to give us the AI we want. 

With all of that said, I don't understand the sell off from Nvidia and to an extent even more so from Microsoft. RL learning and post-query inference processing is at it's absolute infancy. We've just started down this road. At least DeepSeek took a crack at it and open sourced it. Meta I am certain will surely follow that lead and do something similar. But the compute needed for this is much greater than what we needed before with static pre-trained only models like GPT-4o or DeepSeek r1. What's clear as day is that the o1 style models are not passing around inferencing of GPT-4o but something much more tuned and lightweight because of the shear cost and compute power needed to accomplish this.  

The methodologies these models employ will get better, faster and cheaper over time. They will become used way more than ever before. The amount of customers Microsoft serves in this AI space is more than any other compute service provider by FAR. And that is only increasing adoption rate not decreasing. 

The entire story of what is going on and where this is headed will conveyed very well by this upcoming AH earnings call for MSFT. 

Satya Nadella already responded to Stargate, OpenAI and now this by saying these 2 things. 

1. ""I got my $80 Billion so I'm not worried about our customers as we will continue to serve them"" - Translation, we have a plan to build out our infrastructure so nothing has change for Microsoft. The call will be interesting to capture exactly what it's thoughts are on this very subject. 

2. Satya just tweeted a powerful message regarding[ Javons paradox ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)about relating to DeepSeek and further efficiencies mean to the AI landscape. 

https://preview.redd.it/ho3d19a3alfe1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2bf2baa6c40c25367bfbf11150d374f411e93f9

That's really it right. We make electricity more accessible and efficient so we use more of it. We invent automobiles that improve travel so we make more of them. We invent new forms of air travel like Archer Aviation so we will fly in more ways now because of this. We train models for cheaper and run them for cheaper so we serve more AI. We improve and make AI smarter, faster and better and more and more people will use it as not just a service but as a commodity. 

I couldn't of made reference or said it any better than Satya himself.

I fully expect MSFT on Wednesday to quell fears and set the story straight. Amy and Satya I can predict now will say easier training would mean more inference for our customers. This is a great and positive thing. To Jim Fan's point to AI scientist, get to work and build more great things. 

End of story.",1738006997.0,Xtianus25,24,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1ibi25b/microsoft_and_nvidia_stand_at_the_gates_of/,"Microsoft and Nvidia Stand At the Gates of Competition (DeepSeek) - Why are we not celebrating efficiency gains and BUYING this dip? Post-query LLM RL processing is still in its infancy! I look outside and the sky is still blue and hasn't fallen even though CNBC, Meta's Yann LeCun, and Perplexity would have you believe otherwise. 

It will take time, weeks if not months to properly vet what the DeepSeek paper means. I want to be clear All of their weights including bias and other tunings are not present in their hugging face or github repo. I am not backing down from that. What is also not there is any (0) of the data used or training methods used to even begin to know if their magical unicorn poop story of we built a model at a 98% discount is based in any reality. We don't know if they overfitted the model for benchmarks. What we immediately see is that there is CCP China propaganda suppression directly embedded in the model.  

One thing I am clear on is that there was a lot of US data that was used and more than probable usage of US lab frontier models that were used in the creation and making of DeepSeek. It thinks it's GPT-4 and that is not for some accidental reason. It was trained heavily if not entirely on US frontier models. 

Side note, if the U.S. government wanted to ban tik tok how in the world is this not an even great threat? 

But none of that matters. Let's take China for their word and presume that they did exactly what it is that their saying. Let's imagine for a moment that OpenAI or Nvidia came out with the exact same information about efficiency gains would this not be great news? 

If you can train less and inference more isn't that a massive win? 

Jim Fan is a Senior Research Scientist at NVIDIA and had this to say. 

https://preview.redd.it/a8223vwi5lfe1.png?width=829&format=png&auto=webp&s=e34dceffe8282212b3fa6c4cfe9bda3df106e2e1

The o3 model and it's ability to reason and think is light years away from anything that deepseek released. Did they do some version of COT reasoning steps yes you can see it but it's a light hearted copy version of what GPT-o1 is doing today. Literally, it spills out some COT's and resolves to an answer. Is that auto-COT on the same level of o1 or the upcoming o3? I know for a fact that is not the case. 

Still, model training is a portion of what goes on in AI. What you and I see and use has nothing to do with training as we are at the receiving end of inferencing.  We consume the final result of a trained model and with o1-oX it will be that the models effectively go through a  reasoning thought process and relay inferencing back and forth. This isn't some recipe for less compute in the very beginning but rather much more compute. That's what Jim Fan is speaking to. 

The DeepSeek paper will be vetted by our brightest and most accomplished data scientists so I think the world should wait to find out more of what exactly was noteworthy from the accomplishments of that paper, if any. Again, for me, starting with someone else's data and model is quite the shortcut. 

Another issue I have with all of this is NOBODY. No lab, no mater opensource or closes source has effectively beat GPT-4. We are all still using GPT-4. So, I think it is fair to wonder and ask OpenAI where is the next models. Are they going to just drip out models at a very slow pace OR does this give them motivation to go faster and further with less concern about certain safety aspects. 

Again, Jim Fan addressed this clearly. 

https://preview.redd.it/pgq7thnr7lfe1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d40ece46c6235246a1a03db6f1406e2617b4f9

That is a shot in the arm and a wake up call to closed end labs who are developing AI/AGI/ASI. You can't just stand there and horde everything AI whilst at the same time not coming out with another frontier model for over 3 years now. That's a direct shot at that slow roll process. Simply, the world isn't go into a safety bubble and wait from 1 or 3 players to give us the AI we want. 

With all of that said, I don't understand the sell off from Nvidia and to an extent even more so from Microsoft. RL learning and post-query inference processing is at it's absolute infancy. We've just started down this road. At least DeepSeek took a crack at it and open sourced it. Meta I am certain will surely follow that lead and do something similar. But the compute needed for this is much greater than what we needed before with static pre-trained only models like GPT-4o or DeepSeek r1. What's clear as day is that the o1 style models are not passing around inferencing of GPT-4o but something much more tuned and lightweight because of the shear cost and compute power needed to accomplish this.  

The methodologies these models employ will get better, faster and cheaper over time. They will become used way more than ever before. The amount of customers Microsoft serves in this AI space is more than any other compute service provider by FAR. And that is only increasing adoption rate not decreasing. 

The entire story of what is going on and where this is headed will conveyed very well by this upcoming AH earnings call for MSFT. 

Satya Nadella already responded to Stargate, OpenAI and now this by saying these 2 things. 

1. ""I got my $80 Billion so I'm not worried about our customers as we will continue to serve them"" - Translation, we have a plan to build out our infrastructure so nothing has change for Microsoft. The call will be interesting to capture exactly what it's thoughts are on this very subject. 

2. Satya just tweeted a powerful message regarding[ Javons paradox ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)about relating to DeepSeek and further efficiencies mean to the AI landscape. 

https://preview.redd.it/ho3d19a3alfe1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2bf2baa6c40c25367bfbf11150d374f411e93f9

That's really it right. We make electricity more accessible and efficient so we use more of it. We invent automobiles that improve travel so we make more of them. We invent new forms of air travel like Archer Aviation so we will fly in more ways now because of this. We train models for cheaper and run them for cheaper so we serve more AI. We improve and make AI smarter, faster and better and more and more people will use it as not just a service but as a commodity. 

I couldn't of made reference or said it any better than Satya himself. 

AI isn't going anywhere, usage will increase, **you buy this dip**. 

I fully expect MSFT on Wednesday to quell fears and set the story straight. Amy and Satya I can predict now will say easier training would mean more inference for our customers. This is a great and positive thing. To Jim Fan's point to AI scientist, get to work and build more great things.

1ib9we9,NVDA_Stock,NVDA Tanks After DeepSeek Hype—Here’s Why This Jevons Paradox Makes It a Massive Buying Opportunity,"Alright, so NVIDIA (NVDA) is getting hammered pre-market today, dropping from $142 on Friday to $126. Why? Everyone’s freaking out over DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that’s apparently doing more with less. The narrative is that if AI models become more efficient, NVIDIA will sell fewer GPUs. But here’s the thing: this is classic short-term overreaction. In reality, this efficiency story ties into the Jevons Paradox, and it’s actually a bullish case for NVIDIA long-term.

Let me explain why this dip is a buying opportunity.

1. Jevons Paradox: Efficiency = More Demand

The Jevons Paradox says that when something becomes more efficient (in this case, AI compute), it doesn’t reduce demand—it increases it. Why? Because efficiency makes the technology more accessible, which leads to broader adoption and higher overall usage.

Here’s how this applies to NVIDIA:
	•	DeepSeek’s efficient AI models mean more people can now afford to run AI. Startups, small businesses, and even individuals will jump in.
	•	These smaller players still need GPUs, and NVIDIA’s hardware (e.g., RTX 4090s, A100s, DGX systems) is perfectly positioned for this growing market.

2. AI Isn’t Shrinking, It’s Evolving

Let’s be clear: AI demand isn’t going away—it’s just shifting. Instead of a few hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft buying massive GPU clusters, we’re going to see thousands of smaller buyers entering the market.
	•	Local AI Deployments: Efficient models mean companies can run AI locally without relying on cloud services. This creates demand for edge AI hardware, like NVIDIA’s Jetson platform.
	•	Broader Applications: AI will expand into industries like retail, healthcare, and manufacturing, all of which will need GPUs for localized processing.

3. This Sell-Off Is Overblown

The market is panicking because they’re stuck in the old mindset that NVIDIA only sells to hyperscalers. But here’s what they’re missing:
	•	AI Hardware TAM Is Expanding: More users (small businesses, startups, and developers) mean more units sold. Even if they buy mid-tier GPUs instead of H100s, the volume of buyers makes up for it.
	•	NVIDIA Dominates Software: CUDA, TensorRT, and NVIDIA’s AI frameworks are industry standards. Even if smaller buyers enter the market, they’ll almost certainly use NVIDIA hardware to stay compatible with the broader ecosystem.

This isn’t a shrinking demand story; it’s a redistribution of demand.

4. The Bigger Picture

DeepSeek doesn’t hurt NVIDIA—it highlights the democratization of AI. And guess who’s the backbone of this entire movement? NVIDIA. Their hardware and software are so entrenched in AI infrastructure that they’ll thrive whether AI is centralized (hyperscalers) or decentralized (local and edge AI).

This dip is just fear and noise. NVIDIA remains the go-to provider for anyone running AI, whether it’s OpenAI training GPT-5 or a startup fine-tuning a smaller model.

5. Why This Is a Buying Opportunity

At $126 pre-market, NVDA is a steal. The AI revolution isn’t slowing down, it’s accelerating. This dip gives long-term investors the chance to get in before the market realizes what’s actually happening:
	•	More Accessible AI = More Buyers.
	•	Jevons Paradox ensures efficiency leads to higher overall demand.
	•	NVIDIA is still the backbone of AI infrastructure globally.

TL;DR: The DeepSeek hype isn’t bad for NVIDIA—it’s a catalyst for broader AI adoption. Efficiency means AI is more accessible, which creates more demand for GPUs. The Jevons Paradox ensures NVIDIA will sell more hardware, not less, as AI expands into new markets. This sell-off is overblown and a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

Why? Everyone’s freaking out over DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that’s apparently doing more with less. The narrative is that if AI models become more efficient, NVIDIA will sell fewer GPUs. But here’s the thing: this is classic short-term overreaction. In reality, this efficiency story ties into the Jevons Paradox, and it’s actually a bullish case for NVIDIA long-term.

1iann4i,NVDA_Stock,Mirae Securities report on NVDA and large scale GPU clusters,"It looks like the deepseek guys took the H800 which are the nerfed version of H100 and then changed it by dropping down to ptx and allocating sm units to get around nerfed link speed. At least that is what Mirae Asset Securities report is implying. 

Full Report below (including the perceived impact on NVDA shares): 

Does the emergence of DeepSeek mean that cutting-edge LLM development no longer requires large-scale GPU clusters?
• Analysis by Mirae Asset Securities Korea

Does this imply that cutting-edge LLM development no longer needs large-scale GPU clusters? Were the massive computing investments by Google, OpenAI, Meta, and xAI ultimately futile? The prevailing consensus among AI developers is that this is not the case. However, it is clear that there is still much to be gained through data and algorithms, and many new optimization methods are expected to emerge in the future.

Since DeepSeek’s V3 model was released as open source, the technical report on V3 has been described in great detail. This report documents the extent of low-level optimizations performed by DeepSeek. In simple terms, the level of optimization could be summed up as “it seems like they rebuilt everything from the ground up.” For example, when training V3 with NVIDIA’s H800 GPUs, DeepSeek customized parts of the GPU’s core computational units, called SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors), to suit their needs. Out of 132 SMs, they allocated 20 exclusively for server-to-server communication tasks instead of computational tasks.

This customization was carried out at the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) level, a low-level instruction set for NVIDIA GPUs. PTX operates at a level close to assembly language, allowing for fine-grained optimizations such as register allocation and thread/warp-level adjustments. However, such detailed control is highly complex and difficult to maintain. This is why higher-level programming languages like CUDA are typically used, as they generally provide sufficient performance optimization for most parallel programming tasks without requiring lower-level modifications.

Nevertheless, in cases where GPU resources need to be utilized to their absolute limit and special optimizations are necessary, developers turn to PTX. This highlights the extraordinary level of engineering undertaken by DeepSeek and demonstrates how the “GPU shortage crisis,” exacerbated by U.S. sanctions on China, has spurred both urgency and creativity.",1737919427.0,AideMobile7693,18,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1iann4i/mirae_securities_report_on_nvda_and_large_scale/,"Mirae Securities report on NVDA and large scale GPU clusters It looks like the deepseek guys took the H800 which are the nerfed version of H100 and then changed it by dropping down to ptx and allocating sm units to get around nerfed link speed.

1i9p3mq,NVDA_Stock,Why the DeepSeek Buzz Doesn’t Spell Doom for NVIDIA—Short-Term Sell-Off Is Short-Sighted,"
There’s been a lot of noise lately about the emergence of DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup making waves with their efficient AI models like DeepSeek 3. The headlines are focused on how they’ve achieved OpenAI-level performance with less computational power and significantly lower costs. Naturally, some investors are concerned this could hurt NVIDIA (NVDA), whose high-end GPUs are the backbone of AI training and inference. This fear, while understandable, is short-sighted. Let me break down why DeepSeek is not the end of the road for NVIDIA, but actually a harbinger of a shift in demand that could grow their market.

The Short-Term Market Reaction

First, the market’s knee-jerk reaction is typical. When something disrupts the AI narrative—like claims of doing “more with less”—investors panic, especially with a stock as richly valued as NVDA. But the truth is, DeepSeek’s innovations represent a pivot in AI demand, not an elimination of it. Here’s why:

1. Smaller, More Efficient AI Means More Users

DeepSeek’s efficiency breakthroughs, like leveraging Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, mean that AI models will become more accessible to smaller players—startups, SMEs, and even individual developers. No longer will AI be the exclusive domain of tech giants with massive cloud budgets. This creates a new customer base for NVIDIA.
	•	Mini AI Farms: Just like the Bitcoin mining boom led to retail GPU demand, we’ll likely see small businesses and retail developers building “mini AI farms” for localized AI inference and model training.
	•	DGX Supercomputers for the Rest of Us: NVIDIA’s DGX systems (like DGX Station) and mid-tier GPUs (A100s, 4090s, etc.) are perfect for this demand shift, offering scalable, high-performance hardware for small-scale AI projects.

2. The Growing Edge AI Market

With more efficient models, businesses can now run AI at the edge—on local hardware—rather than relying exclusively on cloud services. This aligns with growing demand for decentralized AI applications in fields like:
	•	Healthcare: Hospitals running AI diagnostics locally for speed and privacy.
	•	Manufacturing: Edge AI for robotics and quality control.
	•	Retail: Real-time inventory tracking and customer behavior analysis.

NVIDIA has already positioned itself well in the edge computing market with its Jetson platform. The demand for smaller, less compute-intensive models will only amplify the adoption of NVIDIA’s edge-focused GPUs.

3. Long-Term AI Demand Isn’t Shrinking—It’s Evolving

Let’s be clear: The AI revolution isn’t slowing down; it’s just becoming more broadly distributed. Instead of just a handful of tech giants buying massive GPU clusters, thousands of smaller businesses and researchers will now be in the market for high-performance hardware.
	•	Cloud AI Isn’t Going Anywhere: While edge and local AI will grow, hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google will still need NVIDIA’s top-tier GPUs for training massive foundational models. This core revenue stream remains intact.
	•	Open-Source Models Spur Local AI Growth: With open-sourced efficient models (like DeepSeek 3) gaining traction, NVIDIA will sell more chips to smaller players deploying these models locally.

4. Short-Term Sell-Off Is Overblown

Here’s the key: NVIDIA thrives in a world where AI demand is everywhere, not just centralized in a few hyperscalers. The decentralization trend brought about by DeepSeek-like efficiency advancements actually broadens NVIDIA’s total addressable market (TAM).

Yes, hyperscalers might eventually optimize their demand for GPUs, but the rise of localized, smaller-scale AI operations will more than offset this. In the short term, the sell-off reflects uncertainty, but this is a long-term growth story. NVIDIA has the hardware, software (CUDA, TensorRT), and ecosystem (libraries and frameworks) to meet this demand head-on.

What This Means for NVDA Stock

In my opinion, here’s what to expect:
	1.	Short-Term Volatility: Yes, NVDA might see some price turbulence as the market digests the implications of DeepSeek’s efficiency claims. This is an opportunity, not a risk, for long-term investors.
	2.	Long-Term Growth Potential: With the AI market expanding to smaller businesses, NVIDIA could sell more units across a wider range of customers, reducing dependency on a few hyperscalers. Their DGX systems, Jetson line, and even consumer GPUs (RTX 4090, 4080) are primed for this decentralized AI boom.
	3.	Valuation Upside: As NVIDIA diversifies its customer base, it could achieve more consistent revenue streams across multiple markets (cloud, edge, and local AI), reducing cyclicality and increasing earnings predictability.

Final Thoughts

DeepSeek represents the democratization of AI, and NVIDIA is positioned to thrive in that future. They’re not just a chipmaker—they’re the backbone of AI infrastructure. If anything, DeepSeek’s rise highlights the growing importance of efficient AI hardware and the inevitable demand shift from centralized to localized compute.

The current sell-off is a knee-jerk reaction, but long-term investors should see this as a buying opportunity. NVIDIA’s ability to adapt and supply the tools for this decentralized AI revolution could push the stock even higher in the years to come.

TL;DR: DeepSeek isn’t the end of NVIDIA—it’s a catalyst for a demand shift. Localized AI is the future, and NVIDIA’s diversified hardware portfolio (DGX, Jetson, consumer GPUs) makes them the backbone of this transition. Short-term sell-offs are noise; long-term, NVDA is a winner.",1737818297.0,wanderingtofu,100,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1i9p3mq/why_the_deepseek_buzz_doesnt_spell_doom_for/,"Why the DeepSeek Buzz Doesn’t Spell Doom for NVIDIA—Short-Term Sell-Off Is Short-Sighted

1i6fy1v,NVDA_Stock,Waiting for Passenger Bus and bought NVIDIA stock,"**My Story in Bullet Points:**

* **January 2023:**
   * I was waiting for a passenger bus to go to the office.
   * At that time, I had around $10K in my trading account—just starting my stock market journey.
   * As a deep learning engineer, I knew NVIDIA dominated the GPU market, but I had zero experience in due diligence (DD).
   * On impulse, I decided to invest the entire $10K in NVIDIA stocks while waiting for the bus.
   * It was a ""take the risk and see"" moment—completely unplanned.
* **My Trading Setup:**
   * I had two trading apps: one for short-term investments and another for long-term holdings.
   * I used an iPhone 6s back then and never checked the long-term app regularly.
* **October 2023:**
   * I upgraded to an iPhone 14 but forgot to reinstall my long-term trading app.
   * Almost deleted the app entirely from my life—it wasn’t on my radar anymore.
* **The Shock of a Lifetime (Last Week):**
   * A random thought hit me: *“Didn’t I invest $10K somewhere? Where is it?”*
   * I re-downloaded the app, logged in, and was **completely blown away** by NVIDIA’s performance.
   * The investment had grown significantly, changing how I view earning and investing money forever.

Now, I am thinking to buy more NVIDIA stocks in short-term account

On January 16, 2025, the Bureau of Industry and Security, Department of Commerce, published a rule entitled ""Implementation of Additional Due Diligence Measures for Advanced Computing Integrated Circuits."" The rule is intended to reduce the diversion of ICs to unauthorized end uses or end users that meet the control parameters of ECCN 3A090 by end users who misrepresent the performance capabilities of their ICs to the foundries that manufacture them or the companies that assemble the ICs, or OSATs, into packages. 

The rule requires additional diligence for foundries and OSATs to verify technical parameters, although approved IC designers are considered a reliable source to verify technical parameters of the applicable advanced logic ICs. NVIDIA Corporation is an approved IC designer and thus the rule is not expected to have an impact on our operations or on product sales to China.

1hwxi9a,NVDA_Stock,Biden to Further Limit Nvidia AI Chip Exports in Final Push,"**Summary:**  
[In a final push before leaving office, the Biden administration is preparing one last round of AI chip export restrictions, targeting Nvidia and other semiconductor firms. The move aims to curb AI chip sales to China, Russia, and other adversaries while ensuring US-friendly nations maintain access.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-further-limit-nvidia-ai-214945108.html)

The new rules, expected **as soon as Friday**, would establish **three tiers** of restrictions:

1. **Full access** for top US allies
2. **Complete bans** for adversaries
3. **Limited access** for most other countries, with exceptions for those agreeing to **US security and human rights standards**

Nvidia, the **leading AI chipmaker**, opposes the move, warning that **it threatens economic growth and US leadership** without effectively reducing security risks. **Nvidia’s stock dipped 1%** after the news, despite massive gains in previous years.

**TL;DR:** **Biden admin to tighten AI chip exports before leaving office; Nvidia pushes back, calling it a major policy shift.**

1hwvpc3,NVDA_Stock,How will NVDA profit from Physical AI?,"I watched the entire CES keynote and it was incredible. I own many shares / LEAPs in NVDA and plan to invest for the long haul. 

One question I have is: how does NVDA profit from physical AI?

A big part of justifying NVDA’s continued growth is to demonstrate their ability to enter and grow in non-data center markets. While I am very bullish on the data center buildout and believe it will continue for a decade, Wall Street, I believe, is not certain on this. They tend to hold conservative views on the data center’s buildout. 

As I was listening to Jensen talk about AI Agents, Nvidia Cosmos, etc, every single time he would say “open source”. I understand why there is value in having open source software, but what is NVDA’s plan to make money off of robotics and AVs? Currently they have a tiny amount of revenue from the automative industry, and nothing notable from robotics. 

The data center buildout is hugely profitable because they are able to sell GPUs encased in racks for massive margins. What does the business plan look like for AI agents, robotics and AV?

I of course believe that Jensen and NVIDIA can figure it out, as they have a history of creating billion dollar markets and then dominating them. 

But if everything is open source, how does NVDA profit?

**Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER.NaE)** shares are trading higher premarket on Tuesday after the ride-hailing company and **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA.NaE)** entered into a strategic partnership aimed at advancing AI-powered autonomous vehicle (AV) technology.

The collaboration will leverage NVIDIA’s platforms, including Cosmos and DGX Cloud, to accelerate the development of autonomous driving solutions.

NVIDIA Cosmos is a state-of-the-art platform designed to support the development of physical AI systems like robots and autonomous vehicles, eliminating cost and resource limitations, making it easier for developers to build and deploy AI models at scale.

Additionally, NVIDIA DGX Cloud offers a high-performance, fully managed environment for AI model development.

**Also Read: Uber CFO Says Stock Undervalued, Initiates $1.5 Billion Accelerated Stock Buyback**

By combining Uber’s trove of mobility data with NVIDIA’s AI technology, both companies plan to create more efficient and scalable AI models for the industry.

“Generative AI will power the future of mobility, requiring both rich data and very powerful compute,” said Uber (UBER.NaE) CEO **Dara Khosrowshahi**.

“By working with NVIDIA (NVDA.NaE), we are confident that we can help supercharge the timeline for safe and scalable autonomous driving solutions for the industry.”

In his keynote address at the CES 2025 on Monday, NVIDIA (NVDA.NaE) CEO **Jensen Huang** predicted that self-driving vehicles would become “the first multi-trillion dollar robotics industry.”

Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) will also deploy its Drive AGX Orin supercomputer and operating system for advanced driver assistance features on **Toyota Motor Corp (TM.NaE)**‘s next-generation models.

Some analysts like Dan Niles (and personal friends at Morgan Stanley and Goldman) suggest that hyperscalers may go through a digestion phase due to a few factors:

* Already hyperscalers' Revenue forecasts have declined 4% in 2024 and with next earnings coming up, they need to forecast for 2025. A lower ROI from the hyperscalers will prompt investors to punish their stock which might lead to slower Capex. (To be fair, I heard this exact critique from Goldman anaylsts).
* Cost Sensitivity: smaller enterprises/startups customers are growing sensitive to the high costs of AI workloads. Hyperscalers initially expected robust demand, but sticker shock for cloud AI services is tempering some adoption.
* Companies that adopted AI broadly, such as deploying generative AI tools for employees (e.g., $15/employee/month), often report mixed results. Many employees are finding limited day-to-day utility.
* Budget Constraints: Macroeconomic pressures are pushing customers of hyperscalers to scrutinize discretionary spending.

Bottom line is that if even one hyperscaler pauses or lowers Capex, it will compress Nvidia's valuation which has built-in bulletproof growth expectations. I understand that everyone wants Nvidia's chips (why I want to buy Nvidia again at this price point) but I am worried the AI buildout may not be as linear as everyone forecasts. I am reminded that when everyone expects something with certainty (recession, santa claus rally), those things don't materialize. This is especially true if hyperscalers are reducing revenue guidance and were they to see reduced ROI/ adoption, then I fear this thing might unravel for the very-short ter. Could there be a digestion phase that institutional investors expect which may be compressing valuations as seen in the back half of this year?

  
Just to be clear, I am long Nvidia long term (til 2029) since I think the AI buildout has legs but am scared of Capex pause.

  
I know this sub glazes nvidia (which is fine) but things like Chat GPT have become kind of a meme in public sphere: look at Apple's fumbled AI buildout. We have [Bridget Carey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0V554NyXWM)'s pretty stark reminder of how ludicrous the whole thing is.

Nvidia's stock has surged by 200% this year, with analysts maintaining a bullish outlook on the company's future prospects. Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes compares Nvidia's current trajectory to Apple's early days with the iPhone, highlighting excitement for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip. This chip is expected to enhance power efficiency and computing capabilities, particularly in AI applications like text-to-video and self-driving cars. Big cloud companies are anticipated to continue investing heavily in Nvidia's products.

Nvidia's quarterly sales have surpassed market expectations, with revenue rising 94% year-on-year to $35.1 billion. Net income also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, rising 109% to $19.3 billion. The chipmaker expects to achieve revenue of $37.5 billion in the next quarter.

Analysts remain optimistic about Nvidia's long-term potential, reinforcing their buy ratings amid expectations of continued growth in AI and computing innovations.

1hmnkx7,NVDA_Stock,Beating the LETF Dead Horse,"TLDR:

1. A lot of the 'advice' about LETFs on Reddit is bullshit that doesn't line up with actual data.
2. If you think we're heading into a bad macro-economic year (and that would impact NVDA as well...it doesn't live in magic bubble) then LETFs are probably not the best choice right now.

Using actual daily returns of NVDA and NVDL from 1 Jan 2023 to present, I built a simulated year.  Note: I don't think for one moment that 2023 and 2024 should be considered normal years for NVDA, but NVDL is new so I don't have 10 years of data to rely on.

Then, I assumed a terrible macro-economic year (think 2008, 2022, etc) and cut the returns in half.  In both cases the LETF outperformed the underlying, but in the bear market year, it wasn't by much.  I confirmed that the fees associated with NVDL are baked into the share price, so those are accounted for.  I'm no longer sure, based on actual data, that the assumptions about LETFs being for extremely short term trading, really hold true.  I did not test this against a 3x though, so don't extrapolate beyond what this is showing.

This is the median return of 10,000 model runs.

In the base case, NVDL outperformed NVDA by 58%...significantly less than than the 100% that a 2x LETF might tacitly promise to a someone unfamiliar with them.  Still...that's a BIG performance gap.

In the (as we say at my job) severely adverse scenario, NVDL still outperforms, but only barely.

I think this is evidence that the conventional wisdom about LETFs is sorta right, but largely misunderstood and there's a lot of bad advice floating around about them.  The fact that they have only existed for about 2 years...2 years which have seen sky high returns has hidden the reality of them.  That reality, to me is this:

1. They will probably outperform their underlying, even when held a long time in a normal returns year.
2. In the short term, the impact negative price moves is magnified.  My models get to show 10,000 possible futures.  In the real world, there is only one, and if that future includes some significant drops, your returns could look like [this. At](http://this.At) the 25th percentile in the severely adverse scenario, the LETF underperforms by quite a bit.

The obvious conclusion here is that if you believe that we're heading into a bad macroeconomic year (as I do) then holding NVDL or any other LETF is probably going to to make your shitty returns even worse.

Finally, because no one but me is wondering about this...the returns are identical at the 43rd percentile of the severely adverse scenario.",1735216873.0,QuesoHusker,17,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1hmnkx7/beating_the_letf_dead_horse/,"Beating the LETF Dead Horse TLDR:

My take on the technical chart tea leaves... feel free to agree or disagree...  but now you can't say I didn't contribute!   Looking at NVDA daily 3 month chart, on Tuesday, we just passed upwards on the MACD signal line (See below) shows -1.16 (red line which is above/higher than the green (signal) line of -1.32.   This is a good (Bullish) sign.  If I wanted to add shares, this might nudge me to do so.   If I had no shares, this might nudge me to pick some up.

CMF (supposedly this is telling us big money is buying).

Volumes the volume.  lot's of shares moving.   This month, generally volume is lower than last month by a touch but it's consistent...

I think o3's launch will start a new arms race. NVDA already had pretty good upside heading into 2025 but o3's launch is almost like a ChatGPT 4 moment.

**Massive Growth**: NVIDIA's revenue over the past year has skyrocketed to **$113.27 billion**, and its operating profit (EBIT) has hit an impressive **$71.03 billion**. This shows the company is not just growing but doing so profitably.

**Efficient Business Model**: A big chunk of NVIDIA's revenue turns into profit, proving that its business is highly scalable and efficient.

**Beating Expectations**: NVIDIA consistently outperforms what analysts predict, with its most recent earnings beating estimates by **6.45%**, even in tough market conditions.

Right now, NVIDIA’s Forward P/E is at **33.1x**, which is below its historical average of **39.4x**. This means the stock is trading at a cheaper valuation compared to what investors have been willing to pay for it in the past.

**What’s Happening?** NVIDIA’s P/E was sky-high at **71.0x** in 2021 during the tech boom but dropped to **19.6x** in 2022 as markets corrected. Now, it’s settled at a level that reflects optimism about its growth, but without being overhyped.

This lower valuation could be a great opportunity for long-term investors who believe in NVIDIA’s future, especially as it continues to dominate AI, gaming, and advanced computing.

**Shares peaked in 2022**: NVIDIA was issuing more shares, likely to raise funds or as part of employee stock programs.

**Decline since 2022**: The company has been buying back shares, reducing the total to **24.49 billion**, which helps boost the value of each share and improves earnings per share (EPS).

The reduction in shares signals NVIDIA’s focus on rewarding long-term investors and confidence in its future performance.

**Current EBIT (LTM):** NVIDIA’s operating profit over the past year hit **$71.03 billion**, showing strong performance.

**Future Projections:** Analysts expect EBIT to grow significantly, reaching **$163.66 billion by 2027**, driven by demand for AI and GPUs.

NVIDIA’s profitability is growing fast, and analysts are confident in its future. For long-term investors, it’s a solid bet on cutting-edge tech and sustained growth.

But, since Oct 7, NVDA started setting low-lows and today it even broke its 60-day low of $131.60 last set on Oct 15. It’s more than 10% below its highest ever, meaning it is officially in correction territory..

The 3-month chart doesn’t look good at all, it looks more like a falling knife, not good for us long term NVDA share holders! Would be interesting to see if it is going to the next low of $117.00 set on Oct 1 or if it will recover to set a new highest over $148.88 set on Oct 7.

I don’t see any news that could have triggered the current slide except the good old “high valuation” or profit taking which is normal for such high flying growth stocks.. They have already confirmed that their order book on Blackwell is already full into the calendar years 2025 and 2026 and that they dont see any supply chain issues either.

I think this is probably it. There isn't much work to be done in this last month of the year, pretty much everyone is heading home for the holidays at all the semis, so itll be a quiet couple of weeks. If we hear anything, it'll be something coming from the President elect or overseas （think tsmc). I'll admit the runup was a little more than I was expecting, but unless some huge development between now and next earnings appears, I don't think the runup will be as huge and if there is a beat the beat will not be as huge. 

My plan is probably going to either have cc or puts on next earnings. My logic is that stocks pop after earnings because wall street isn't surprised by the earnings necessarily, but because they are surprised more by the earning potential, and as nvda's market share (inevitably) drops and along with it their profit margins wall street is going to move on. 

Not saying that there is no more growth to be made, I'm simply stating the fact that market forces are probably going to see this as the next blue chip stock with steady, reliable growth (think aapl or msft) rather than the next up and coming.

My most reasonable prediction is that NVDA will probably slightly outpace the rest of the mag7, but not by much. Right now I think the Ai environment is dominated by chips and llm generation, but very few commercial applications. It might be time to move on to the application side of things as AI promises start to kick in. I think MSFT is a strong pick here.

As for competitors, I think as application starts to kick in for ai to where non-hyperscalers see fit to purchase chips, I think the older H100 or alterative chips (AMD's MI300) will start seeing play. My reasoning is that smaller scale retailers only need so much computing power to where the cost of the more expensive chips isn't worth it.

1hcm2vg,NVDA_Stock,Some reflections on NVDA while we wait patiently,"It's hard to watch stocks like TSLA and GOOG spiking up while NVDA slides sideways.  No doubt there are some that are getting itchy trigger fingers thinking about selling and heading to greener pastures.

Here are some points to consider while we wait patiently for the stock to catch up to reality:

* In the most recent Q, NVDA make more in Net Income than they did in Revenue from the Q a year ago.  Revenue-wise that was a 94% increase YoY.
* Blackwell has been shipping in volume this Q, and will have a material impact on the next Earnings.
* Hopper is still in high demand so Blackwell adds overall rather than replaces sales.
* Blackwell based consumer GPUs launch next month.  These will be highly desirable by the ""mining"" community and will be sold out for some time to come.
* The ""moat"" is still massive.  Goog's quantum chip in no way affects NVDA.  Amazon's chip is not even an AWS offering. AMD doesn't have CUDA, and AMD management was cautionary over data center sales.
* The share buyback continues.
* Beth Kindig of the I/O fund is forecasting earnings in FY2026 that are 30% higher than that what the current analyst estimates are forecasting.  She has a very deep understanding of the business and has a very large NVDA position percentage-wise in the I/O fund.
* While a small component to overall Revenue, their automotive division is growing at a fantastic pace  (60% YoY)
* Gross Profit was 75% last Q.  The Blackwell ramp will impact that, but the company expects to return to the mid 70's by mid-year.  75% is ridiculously good.
* The average of the analyst estimates for the next Q is $0.01 (a penny) more than what was actually delivered last Q.  The majority of analysts have not yet provided their updated guidance for next Q and FY2026.

All the while, the stock has been trading at (on average) the same level for 3 months - $140ish. It has been a good pause for those that have been adding to their NVDA piles.  2025 (FY26) is going to be an amazing year!

1hc34en,NVDA_Stock,Broadcom Earnings Pending: A Potential Santa Clause Rally,"There's been a lot of posts and comments on this sub and others about Nvidia's price fluctuations and what the price could be by the end of the year. 

In most stocks, there has been a huge post election rally and Santa Clause rally. Especially in stocks like Palantir, Tesla, IonQ, and RGTI. Yet Nvidia has been stagnant. That's not bad and definitely better than the 10% drop after the prior earnings down into the 90s but considering Broadcom is up 7% today and reports earnings tomorrow, plus Nvidia still can grow tremendously - I think the potential is there to reach $150 by end of year and $200 by end of next year.

The fluctuation and drop we saw since the earnings release is normal. Nvidia - while growing a lot and still has a bright future - won't grow 200% every year from now on. We have to remember that every $10 increase now was a $100 increase before the stock split. 

I'm all for stock splits, but when you get a stock that has split so many times it seems like to some degree the split becomes deceptive to some degree because the stock price hasn't changed - just the perception.

ER:

* Oracle on Monday, this one will be good for NVDA 🎉.
* C3.ai, hope this shady company announces good results.
* Adobe and Broadcom on Thursday, this ones will indicate how healthy the AI theme is.

Sales report: 

* TSMC normally announces on 8/10, can be VERY positive if the number stays close to last one. May even be another record sales 🤞...

Macro:

CPI on Wednesday, it's expected to come a bit hot but the last PCE kind of started a rotation back into tech and semis from small caps which was the theme at that time, so bad=good 

Max pain at 140, but the levels are a bit crazy: 

* First largest OI calls at 148, second at 157.5

Nvidia CEO and Founder Jensen Huang lands at No. 2 on the 2024 Fortune Most Powerful People list.

In a Silicon Valley culture known for “grindset” founders, Jensen Huang still manages to stand out. The Nvidia chief executive told Stripe CEO Patrick Collison earlier this year that he is either working, or thinking about work, every waking moment—and that he works seven days a week. 

>“If you want to build something great, it’s not easy. You have to suffer, you have to struggle, you have to endeavor,” Huang said. “And there are no such things that are great, that are easy to do.”

Well, no one doubts Huang has built something great. Under his leadership, Nvidia has positioned itself at the heart of the artificial intelligence boom. Its graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized for training and running the most powerful AI models, dominate that market, accounting for the overwhelming majority of GPUs sold into data centers in 2023. Nvidia’s share price has increased more than sevenfold since OpenAI’s ChatGPT debuted in November 2022, and the company is now among the most highly valued in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion.

Demand for Nvidia’s most advanced GPU systems routinely outstrips supply—the entire 2025 production of its most advanced Blackwell chip is, according to a report from Morgan Stanley, already sold out. Elon Musk and Oracle founder Larry Ellison took Huang out for dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto to personally lobby him for larger allocations of his GPU production. Such hunger helps explain why Nvidia’s revenues for the current fiscal year—2025—are estimated to be $125 billion, more than double last year’s figure, which itself was more than double 2023’s tally. And its operating profit margin is north of 60%.

It’s not just Fortune 500 CEOs who are eager to meet with Huang. The White House has sought his views on AI, and he’s consulted with world leaders including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the UAE’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. The U.S. sees Nvidia’s leading edge in GPUs for AI as a key national security asset, and the Biden administration has restricted the sale of its more advanced chips to China—a move that might have been more damaging to Nvidia’s prospects if it hadn’t been seeing such explosive demand everywhere else. 

Yet it is far from certain that Nvidia will be able to hold on its market position as it faces new threats, not just from its old competitor AMD, but a host of well-funded new startups eager to grab a slice of the AI computing market, as well as from the internal AI chip efforts of the large cloud computing companies that are also its best customers. Despite its success, Huang himself remains acutely aware that Nvidia’s leadership position could prove fleeting—which may explain his relentless work ethic. “I do everything I can not to go out of business,” he told a magazine reporter last year. “I do everything I can not to fail.”

From Denny’s to dominance

It was a long and uncertain path that brought Huang to such heights. Born in Taiwan, he came to the U.S. as a child and went on to earn degrees in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and Stanford. He worked on software and chip design for LSI Logic and AMD before leaving to cofound Nvidia in 1993. 

At the time, the Santa Clara, Calif.–based startup was one of dozens springing up to build specialized graphics cards—they weren’t yet called GPUs—to enable computers to run video games faster. Nvidia was also among a new generation of “fabless” semiconductor companies—it designed the computer chips it sold, but it contracted out their manufacturing to foundries owned by others. Over the next three decades, Nvidia and its rival AMD emerged to dominate that market.

In the mid-2000s, artificial-intelligence researchers realized that GPUs could help them train and run large artificial neural networks—a kind of AI loosely based on how the human brain works—much more efficiently than conventional chips. Training large neural networks requires a chip to perform many of the same kinds of calculations millions or billions of times. Standard computer chips, called central processing units, or CPUs, can only perform one calculation at a time. GPUs, on the other hand, can perform many similar calculations in parallel, vastly accelerating the time it takes to run AI models. Huang presciently recognized the importance of this market and began promoting Nvidia’s chips specifically to AI researchers and engineers.

The key to Nvidia’s success, however, has been more than just designing ever faster and more powerful GPUs. The company has long taken a “full stack” approach: It designs not just chips, but also the software to run them and the cabling to connect them. In 2007, it introduced CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), an open-source software programming language that helped coders run AI applications on GPUs. And it invested heavily in promoting CUDA and training engineers to use it. Today there are an estimated 5 million CUDA developers around the world. Their familiarity with CUDA has been a powerful factor in preventing rival AI-chip companies, which have mostly underinvested in creating similar software and developer communities, from challenging Nvidia’s dominance.

In 2019, Nvidia bought Israeli networking and switching company Mellanox for $7 billion. The deal gave Nvidia the technology to help its customers build giant clusters of tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs, optimized for training the largest AI models. And Nvidia has continued to move up the stack, too—building its own AI models and tools, in an effort to encourage businesses to use generative AI. In 2023, Nvidia announced that it would, for the first time, begin offering its own AI cloud computing services directly to corporate customers, in a move that puts it in direct competition with the giant cloud “hyperscalers,” such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon’s AWS, that are among its best customers.

“If you want to build something great, it’s not easy. You have to suffer, you have to struggle, you have to endeavor. And there are no such things that are great, that are easy to do.”

Jensen Huang, CEO and founder, Nvidia

Huang has fashioned himself as a rock-star founder-CEO, complete with a signature uniform of black leather jacket, black T-shirt, and black jeans. But unlike many of his tech peers, he comes off as self-deprecating and folksy in interviews. He jokes about cleaning toilets as a teenage busboy at Denny’s, and about his habit of getting up at 5 a.m. but then reading in bed until 6 a.m. because he feels guilty waking up his dogs too early. He admitted recently on a podcast with Rene Haas, the CEO of chip design company Arm and a former Nvidia employee, that he didn’t have any particular secret to hiring good people. “We’re not always successful, look how you turned out,” Huang ribbed Haas. “It’s always a shot in the dark.”

Huang’s humility and down-to-earth persona have made him an effective salesperson for Nvidia’s GPUs, and allowed him to build critical partnerships with top executives at companies such as OpenAI and Microsoft, as well as networking equipment makers like Broadcom.   

It has also helped him maintain an unconventional management culture—particularly for a company that employs more than 30,000 people. Huang has 60 direct reports and is known, as Haas put it delicately, for “reaching down into different layers of the organization” (or, to put it less delicately, micromanaging). This flat structure can make Nvidia a tough place to work, but Huang sees it as critical to ensuring the organization is strategically aligned and nimble enough to stay at the cutting edge of rapidly evolving chip development and AI progress.

Huang says he is allergic to hierarchy and corporate silos. He doesn’t believe in one-on-one meetings. Instead, he prefers mass gatherings of his leadership team: He says all Nvidia execs should be able to learn from the feedback he provides to any one of them, and they should all benefit from watching him together as he puzzles through a problem.

Looming challenges to Nvidia’s top-dog status

For all his sometimes folksy charm, lately Huang has begun sounding increasingly prophetic and utopian. In his public comments, he has posited that the world is witnessing a new industrial revolution in which “AI factories” transform data and electricity into “intelligence tokens”—and in which there’s a fundamental shift in computing, with GPUs gaining at the expense of CPUs. 

To keep the competition at bay, Nvidia has upped the tempo at which it is rolling out new generations of top-of-the-line GPUs, going from releasing a new model every other year to an annual release schedule. It is also buying out capacity at TSMC’s foundries, which manufacture all of Nvidia’s chips, to try to prevent competitors from being able to use TSMC’s facilities to produce rival products. It launched a software tool called Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIMs) that makes it easier for developers to set up and run existing AI models on cloud-based Nvidia GPUs without having to know as much about CUDA. 

Some investors believe Nvidia will live up to Huang’s vision of making the GPU the essential hardware unit of all computing—and justify its outsize market cap. Bank of America’s equity analysts recently put forth a bullish scenario based on the tens of billions of dollars that Big Tech companies from Microsoft to Meta to Apple have announced they will invest in computing infrastructure over the next several years. The analysts noted that these purchases could translate into significantly higher growth for Nvidia’s data-center networking solutions, and they pointed out that TSMC has seemingly overcome production issues that had limited initial shipments of the Blackwell chip. They put a price target of Nvidia’s stock of $190 per share, 30% above its current record high.

Others are less sanguine. Businesses have struggled to figure out how to derive value from generative AI. Indeed, technology analytics firm Gartner says AI is entering what it calls “the trough of disillusionment”—in which people realize a much-hyped technology cannot live up to inflated expectations and drastically pare back spending on it. And while George Brocklehurst, a Gartner research vice president, says he expects this downturn to be short-lived, ending in 2027, it wouldn’t bode well for Nvidia’s revenues or stock price in the interim. At the same time, Brocklehurst says he expects AMD to begin to eat into Nvidia’s market share for data center GPUs and the hyperscale cloud companies to continue to invest in their own alternative to Nvidia’s chips. AMD has forecast it will sell $5 billion worth of such GPUs this year. “That is a reasonable toe in the door,” he says, and indicates that for the right price and performance, developers are willing to move away from CUDA. He says the market is increasingly intolerant of Nvidia’s near-monopoly position and the control and pricing power that gives it. (Nvidia says that it controls far less of the market for AI chips than critics charge when one also looks at the competition from chips that the hyperscale cloud companies, such as Google and AWS, design and produce themselves for their own data centers.)

Nvidia has also optimized its GPUs for training the largest, most powerful AI models. But when it comes to running applications on already trained AI models—which is called inference—there are indications that a number of new kinds of chips, including those from upstart AI-chip companies such as startups Groq and Etched, as well as offerings from AMD, and possibly even Intel, can match or outperform Nvidia’s GPUs at a lower cost. In addition, smaller AI models—which could even be run on devices like laptops or smartphones equipped with AI accelerators built by companies such as Qualcomm—may come to be the primary engines for many AI use cases. Nvidia currently doesn’t have significant hardware offerings in that market.

Another challenge: China and geopolitics. The Biden administration slapped export controls on the most sophisticated of Nvidia’s chips, preventing their shipment to China. Nvidia has created a “de-featured” version of its powerful H100 GPU, called the H20, which falls just below the thresholds of these export restrictions, and has proved popular in China—so much so that Chinese AI companies have become adept at using H20s, as well as their own homegrown GPUs from companies such as Huawei, to train AI models that are, by many measures, just as capable as those trained on Nvidia’s more potent GPUs.

These techniques for ringing performance out of ostensibly less capable chips may ultimately help companies elsewhere avoid having to pay top dollar to use Nvidia’s highest-end products. Moreover, an incoming Trump administration is likely to further ratchet up restrictions on chip sales to China, potentially hurting Nvidia’s sales. (China currently accounts for about 12% of Nvidia revenue.) And, of course, there’s always a risk of China moving against Taiwan militarily, which would disrupt Nvidia’s supply chain, which is heavily dependent on TSMC’s semiconductor foundries on the island.

Right now, Huang is pursuing the only sensible strategy available given Nvidia’s position and inflated investor expectations, says Alvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. “He’s circling the wagons and trying to create this fear of missing out \[on AI\] among potential customers,” he says. But the strategy may only work for a little while. Long-term, given all the factors arrayed against it, Nguyen says, “I’d be very surprised if they were able to keep their dominance.”

Of course, competitors have bet against Huang before and been proven wrong. But the chips on the other side of the table have never been piled quite this high.

Nvidia currently doesn’t have significant hardware offerings in that market.

Another challenge: China and geopolitics. The Biden administration slapped export controls on the most sophisticated of Nvidia’s chips, preventing their shipment to China. Nvidia has created a “de-featured” version of its powerful H100 GPU, called the H20, which falls just below the thresholds of these export restrictions, and has proved popular in China—so much so that Chinese AI companies have become adept at using H20s, as well as their own homegrown GPUs from companies such as Huawei, to train AI models that are, by many measures, just as capable as those trained on Nvidia’s more potent GPUs.

These techniques for ringing performance out of ostensibly less capable chips may ultimately help companies elsewhere avoid having to pay top dollar to use Nvidia’s highest-end products. Moreover, an incoming Trump administration is likely to further ratchet up restrictions on chip sales to China, potentially hurting Nvidia’s sales. (China currently accounts for about 12% of Nvidia revenue.) And, of course, there’s always a risk of China moving against Taiwan militarily, which would disrupt Nvidia’s supply chain, which is heavily dependent on TSMC’s semiconductor foundries on the island.

Right now, Huang is pursuing the only sensible strategy available given Nvidia’s position and inflated investor expectations, says Alvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. “He’s circling the wagons and trying to create this fear of missing out \[on AI\] among potential customers,” he says. But the strategy may only work for a little while. Long-term, given all the factors arrayed against it, Nguyen says, “I’d be very surprised if they were able to keep their dominance.”

Of course, competitors have bet against Huang before and been proven wrong. But the chips on the other side of the table have never been piled quite this high.

1h4mj3f,NVDA_Stock,Nvidia: Still Charging Ahead?,"NVIDIA's AI-driven growth is surging, with sales hitting a $150 billion annual run rate despite supply constraints and production delays with new Blackwell GPUs.

The company is reporting unsustainable margins that will normalize over the long term; however, current momentum suggests further upside over the next 1 to 2 years.

The stock should have more upside based on the cheap valuation compared to growth rates with the stock only trading at 31x FY26 EPS targets.

The world continues to charge into AI data center demand that **NVIDIA Corporation** (NASDAQ:NVDA) (NEOE:NVDA:CA) has easily hurdled a couple of apparent hiccups with their new Blackwell GPUs. The chip company will face major long-term margin compression, but for now, the business should charge ahead. My investment thesis remains Bullish, with the market somewhat fighting the expected strong results ahead.

* Still Supply Constrained

Nvidia just reported a quarter where sales grew an astonishing $5 billion sequentially. The GPU company reported revenues of $35 billion, beat consensus estimates by nearly $2 billion.

The company had only reported a sequential quarterly beat of $4 billion in FQ2 to reach $30 billion after hitting $26 billion in FQ1. Nvidia shows no signs of slowing down, despite apparent manufacturing issues with the new Blackwell GPUs and issues with ongoing supply constraints.

The incredible part is that Nvidia went into the FQ2 earnings report back in September with guidance for revenues of $28 billion and ended the recent quarter with guidance for FQ4 sales of $37.5 billion. Within a 3-month period, quarterly sales exceptions surged to nearly $10 billion.

The GPU company is growing at unprecedented levels for a company now hitting an annual run rate of $150 billion in sales. Nvidia has grown trailing data center revenues 6-fold in just a couple of years, with quarterly revenues now double prior annual revenues.

The interesting part of the story is that the new Blackwell GPUs are so complex, investors shouldn't have really been surprised with any production delays. The Blackwell GPU is a marvel of modern chip design with 208 billion transistor manufactured using a custom-built TSMC 4NP process.

The big hyperscalers have apparently ordered a massive amount of the GB200 chips. **Google** (GOOG) has ordered 400K chips valued at $10 billion, while **Meta Platforms** (META) ordered 360K chips for $8 billion. Regardless of these volume levels, Morgan Stanley recently reported Blackwell chips were already sold out for the next 12+ months.

* **Revenue**: $35.1 billion
* **Revenue Growth**: 25%
* **Earnings per Share (EPS)**: $0.78
* **Adjusted Quarterly Revenue**: $35.1 billion \* 1.25 = $43.875 billion
* **EPS Growth**: Assume proportional increase in EPS due to revenue growth

# Calculations:

1. **Adjusted EPS**: $0.78 \* 1.25 = $0.975
2. **Annualized Adjusted EPS**: $0.975 \* 4 = $3.90

# Lower Boundary (Using Apple's PE Multiple):

* **Fair Value using Apple’s PE Multiple**: $3.90 \* 35.2 = **$137.28**

# Upper Boundary (Using Tesla's PE Multiple):

* **Fair Value using Tesla’s PE Multiple**: $3.90 \* 85.3 = **$332.67**

So, with the adjusted earnings and using Apple's PE multiple, the lower boundary for the fair value of NVIDIA's stock would be **$137.28**, and using Tesla's PE multiple, the upper boundary would be **$332.67**.



....Let's refine the upper boundary using half of Tesla's PE multiple.

# Refined Upper Boundary Calculation

* **Tesla's Average PE Multiple**: 85.3
* **Half of Tesla's PE Multiple**: 85.3 / 2 = 42.65

# Updated Fair Value with 0.5 x Tesla's PE

* **Fair Value using 0.5 x Tesla's PE**: $3.90 (annualized adjusted EPS) \* 42.65 = **$166.34**

# Summary of Boundaries

* **Lower Boundary (Apple's PE Multiple)**: $137.28
* **Upper Boundary (0.5 x Tesla's PE Multiple)**: $166.34

So, based on your criteria, the fair value of NVIDIA's stock should be between **$137.28** and **$166.34**.

Just for fun, i told Copilot to run a back of envelope analysis of what NVDA fair value might be using AAPL and TSLA (initially, but updated later with x 50%) multiples as lower and upper boundaries respectively. Also to assume 15% discount rate and 25% annual growth to revenue and earnings. Here's what it came up with:
