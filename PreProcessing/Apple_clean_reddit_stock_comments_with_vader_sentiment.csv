To answer your question, no one knows. All we know is past history, which doesn’t dictate the future, but can be useful data.

My opinion, is that Apple stock might be a bit rocky in the near term. Primarily because Trump is so unpredictable. He recently called for 100% tariffs on TSMC chips. You just never know what he will do and the market can over react.

That said, in the long run, my opinion (again) is that Apple will continue to be one of the most valuable companies in the world. They are extremely well run. They have a differentiated product, that acts as their moat. And they have an enormous fan base.

I only add to Apple or FBCG. Check out FBCG. Such a banger fund. New as well, a few years old. I thought Apples max return was crazy, Nividas is wild! nearly 3x Apples. The only thing that angers me about FBCG, is a few weeks ago. They lowered apple from #1 to #2 holding. With Nivida replacing it! Was pissed! Only by 0.01% but still. Adds to much movement. Maybe they will switch back shortly. Happy Thanksgiving!",0.0502283105022831,83,73,Positive

gxhz0h4,n7xdi2,applestocks,Retail-Investor,"I have a confession.  I sold out of my Apple position about a year ago.  I am disappointed in AAPL as a tech company.  I have listed my reasons for my disappointment below.  Reason 1: Apple has not come out with any significant AR (augmented reality) offerings after a bunch of hype 3 or 4 years ago.  Reason 2: The iPhone still has the notch since the iPhone 10.  Reason 3: Apple TV+ is a big disappointment; they have, at best, 3 good shows worth watching.  Reason 4: Apple has not really come with anything really new and exciting since AppleWatch.  In my opinion, Apple should be “crushing” it with a big over the top round face AppleWatch; a “notch less” iPhone full screen and AppleGlass (Apple glasses) with AR/VR.  Finally, if Apple wants to excite even the historians that will write the AAPL legacy—Apple should “go for broke” and smash on the scene with AppleCar.  But none of this will ever happen—never!

Any time a shareholder offers shares on the open market, they’re in a state of sin.  

They’re saying, in effect, “Hey you, dirtbag, the one with the cash? You should trade your cash for my shares. Let me tell you how good these shares are. They are going to the moon! Your cash isn’t going anywhere. These shares are much better than your cash. If I agree to trade these shares for your cash, I am doing you a huge favor. These shares are obviously worth a lot more than your cash, and that’s why you should give me your cash and take the shares. If I had cash, I would buy these shares, because this price is really good. I wish I could own more of these shares than I already do, they are so good, so because I like you, I want you to take the shares and I will take your cash.”  

A stock buyback avoids all of that. Apple says “Hey shareholders, if any of you want to withdraw your share of the company in cash, you can give us back your shares and we will give you cash. We don’t care why you want cash, whether it’s to pay your bills or to buy shares in another company or treasury bonds.
