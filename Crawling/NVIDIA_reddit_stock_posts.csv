1j01ba4,NvidiaStock,CUDA-Q is the Next Long-Term Strategy (Saving Grace) for Nvidia,"Looking at the current trends, I see Nvidia losinf market share as an AI acceleration platform. Once competitors figure out how to scale up shared GPGPU and CPU memory and do fast inference, I think Nvidia will lose a lot of power as a stock.

That being said, I think you'll still see upward trends for the next 2-10 years because of CUDA-Q. AFAIK, Qiskit, Cirq, etc. will still need AI to optimize quantum algorithms and qubit placements, and GPGPUs scale well for simulating quantum systems.

This is beyond useful because there will be an initial shortage of quantum computers as they perfect their systems, but scientists can develop more algorithms and practice quantum computing on traditional hardware. Best example of how green we are is a single Google search into the applications of Quantum computing. Having simulated systems to test on before real quantum computers will be a step for quantum computing development.

(For disclosure, beyond Shor's algorithm and maybe some stuff with regards to meteorology and optimization techniques, I don't really see any benefit with quantum computers. But I think getting more ready simulations available for scientists to learn with and explore will be a huge first and profitable step, especially considering the operational costs that will likely be associated with a full-on quantum computer. I think this is Jensen's consensus too.)

Let me know if you think I'm wrong. I just don't see Nvidia maintaining its premium valuation if competitors come in with cheaper and more cost efficient options for AI inference. Even for automotive, you are more focusing on inference using trained models than raw training compute power.",1740723681.0,mahmirr,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1j01ba4/cudaq_is_the_next_longterm_strategy_saving_grace/,"CUDA-Q is the Next Long-Term Strategy (Saving Grace) for Nvidia Looking at the current trends, I see Nvidia losinf market share as an AI acceleration platform.

1izfxea,NvidiaStock,"Detailed take on NVDA earnings from someone who actually read the full earnings transcript. Clearly a solid print, being hurt due to tariff mentions on the analyst call. Gross margin miss is a red herring as will clear up by H2","Okay let's get into this print.¬†

The headline numbers you can find literally anywhere including on CNBC so let's just get into the nitty gritty of key points and what I think¬†

Earnings were extremely strong. Beat and raise quarter, but the smallest raise in a year. Still, mostly just the law of large numbers now.

Their gross margin miss, albeit slight, took some initial headlines before the earnings call. This is totally a non event anyway. It was just due to rushed product launches which narrowed the gross margins, and they mentioned that this will be fixed by H2 anyway, so not a big deal.¬†

BTW, these gross margins are literally some of the best margins of any company. For a hardware company, they are literally unbelievable, but I guess NVDA is not just a hardware company as I have mentioned before due to the significance of their CUDA software.¬†

Key thing they addressed that everyone had ears for was Deepseek. They said that the new AI model optimisation, aka deepseekseek, will merely BOOST demand. This reinforces what I said about Deepseek from he start, which is that due to the Jevon's principle, more efficient Ai means more AI which means more power needed to computer, which is good for NVDA.¬†

Key comments from his CNBC call struck me as around the fact that the next generation of AI will need 100x more the computer than olde models. I mean, clearly this is very bullish for NVDA.¬†

On China, he mentioned that obviously the US chips are way more powerful, and can compute 60x faster, which will alleviate some fears of China storming ahead in the AI race, but what he mentioned about China with regards to NVDA was less positive unfortunately as he mentioned that revenue in China was almost double what it is now, before export controls. So they re being constrained by these controls. They are taking an impact, which isn't ideal, but to be expected and the takeaway is that they are still executing at a pristine level despite this.¬†

Blackwell - Jensen argued that production has ramped up, and that demand is greater than ever. Was a little vague about how long he sees demand outstripping supply which had he been more precise on would have given the stock more reason to boost, but the key takeaway is that any fears around Blackwell are at the current moment unfounded. Said that Blackwell Sid delivering $11B in Q4.¬†

Blackwell Ultra is on track for H2 2025, and they're already planning for the next step with Verarubin.

No real signals here that demand is slowing, in light of deepseek.¬†

The earnings for me literally reinforce that NVDA is playing a totally different game to the rest of the market, and that they are totally elite compared to other chip makers in particular.¬†

So then, the big question is why not the squeeze. And the answer there is firstly, not yet. We do need to see how that materialises into the rest of the week.¬†

Butt the reality is that the move higher was On. NVDA was literally up on the print, had it not been for the question on the earnings call regarding tariffs.¬†

See, tariffs have obviously been taking headlines in the market, and that was most obvious yesterday itself. As SPX was staging a recovery back to 6000, which was always set to be a key level to breach, Trump drops more tariff news, which caused the market to dump back to being red on the day.¬†

Investors are very worried about tariffs, it's the focus of the wall of worry right now due to potentially stagflationary impacts. Now when the analyst asked about tariffs, NVDA management basically said that they don't know the full extent of the impact of tariff.¬†

And that was enough to send the stock lower. So right now the tariff narrative is cannibalising the squeeze in NVDA, but the bias for now remains on the up side IMO after this print.¬†

Was a very strong print.

So what does it mean for our positions, notably if you bought something in NVDA before the print, or in other AI hardware names. Are your positions dead? Well, if you bought short dated calls, which I always mention not to do, there could be some issue, BUT if you bought stock or mid to long dated calls, then no. They aren't dead. These earnings don't sound like the kind of earnings where you'd say ""ah I fucked up"".¬†

These were solid earnings and we have to see how the rest of the week plays out. A gamma squeeze is not out of the equation. We still have analyst upgrades to come in, but we must recognise that most of the Street has a buyer rating on NVDA, so we won't see many Neutral to Buy ratings which typically bring the biggest stock reaction.¬†

BUT we will see a bunch of price target upgrades I believe off these numbers.¬†

Now if the stock dips, what's the gameplay?

Well, key gamma level and put support is still at 120. As long as we are above that, we're good.

And above that there's a support at 124.¬†

Now on the upside, we want to break above 134.4 to mov higher. that's the breakout level.¬†

1izb97x,NvidiaStock,"The turning point of NVDA is not there yet, still has room to run","Just some random thoughts about NVDA earnings on Wed.

I listened to the earnings conference call today, as well as the past four calls. The numbers are very good, as shown and discussed in other posts. But, I have to say that the Q&A part is not that great.

They did not prepare well enough:

1. the CFO was not smooth about certain things,
2. Jensen should address DeepSeek more directly and earlier in the Q&A. He did mention that in the final remarks, but he should do that in the very beginning. Also, some numbers should help.
3. Some of the answers are too technical, should think about how to communicate with the market better;
4. most importantly, Jensen sounded tired during the call, while he was super excited in the call of Feb 2024. Last February, the stock price dropped dramatically when the earnings were released, but it jumped super high when Jensen started talking during the Q&A. He started talking about what is Gen AI before answering any questions. That was super energetic! I think that is one reason that the after-market reactions turned into negative in the end today.

I also watched some short clips of Jensen's CNBC interview. He was fine but some of his answers are just too technical to the general audience.

Of course, Jensen has been the best CEO. Nothing to complain. Also, I am holding the stocks and did not sell a share today.

Finally, the market sentiment is not good today due to the tariff news. The economic policy uncertainty is just high to the sky. Although many of us already expected that, it is still hard to stomach it when it finally comes. It will be a rollercoaster ride this year.

The biggest concern about NVDA is that there will be turning point that the AI focus will be no longer about chips, it is about applications of AI. This turning point is not there yet because there is not clear application yet. There is a WSJ article today mention that big tech companies are still spending more money on the AI race. Thus, there is still room for NVDA to run. 

NVDA stock may rise this week or next week, then GTC is from March 17-21. Jensen's keynote speech is on March 18. Based on last year's data point, there might be a jump around that time. Last year, the bull run was 20% up from Feb earnings to 3-4 days after GTC.

1iz8rza,NvidiaStock,The hard truth you don‚Äôt want to hear about NVDA,"
NVIDIA is a household name and has been for the last year. The real winners have already taken profits, and NVDA is no longer a hidden gem. Its growth is fully priced in.

The earnings report was great, but the stock didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmoon‚Äù. Future growth is priced in, and while the numbers look strong now, analysts may not react well once revenue growth starts to decelerate (which it will). 

DeepSeek has made one thing clear.. LLMs are becoming more efficient, and over time, they will require fewer chips alongside general AI initiatives. The research is already out there, and as optimization improves (+ more in house chip efforts), demand for NVDA‚Äôs products will decrease. This isn‚Äôt a death sentence for the company, but it does mean the explosive growth phase may be behind us. 

NVDA won‚Äôt disappear, but the stock will likely continue trading in a range, as it has been. Investors who recognize this reality understand that making money in the market is about catching waves early, not riding them until they flatten.

If you had taken some NVDA profits and rotated into a name like PLTR or META, you‚Äôd be in a much better position. Hindsight 20/20 sure, but the reality of slowing growth will start setting in.

Cliffs: Expectations for NVDA are too high. The growth is already priced in, and the returns moving forward will likely be mediocre.

I‚Äôm a college student, and I originally had $23,000 in savings. A few months back, I took $10,700 from the above money and opened a brokerage account.

I managed to grow that $10,700 to $12,500 using options. But three days back, I went for more short-term LUNR/ rcat call options, the market crashed, and now my account is down to $7,600. I sold everything and $7600 is in the brokerage now( after the loss) 

So I‚Äôve lost $3,100 from my initial investment (not counting the profits I made earlier, let‚Äôs forget about that profit). 

And honestly, I feel like I‚Äôm gonna go insane. I wish I could go back to time. 

How do I recover this $3,100? Should I move the additional $12,300 from my savings into my brokerage account to make it easier to recover?

Or should I just step away from trading for a few months and forget about the money? I have no idea what to do.

Right now, my total remaining money is:

$12,300 (savings) + $7,600 (brokerage) = $19,900.   

Should I use all of 19,900$ to recover my losses? Should I stop trading options? Buy LEAPs instead? Or should I just never trade again?

Any advice would be really appreciated.

1iz56gw,NvidiaStock,I don't care where nvda goes this year I'm still holding 18% of my portfolio in it folks!,"I have 18% of my $240 million portfolio in nvda and I'm sitting pretty!

I could care less if it goes to $5 a share or $150 a share any time this year!

The reason my portfolio is $240 million is cause I never sold nothing the last 15 years! I've just held like dead people do!

So 15 years ago.my 92 year grandma passed and I inherited $145 million from sale of 5 rental properties she owned that got converted to condos in a yuppie area of town. 

Anyways, at the time I didn't know anything about investing and someone at work (McDonald's French fry cook at the time) mentioned sp500 etf.

I said ""what the heck is an etf?""... then I got turned on to Cramer on Mad Money and was hooked!

Basically he taught me to buy and hold stocks and not etfs!  He said ""put your first $10k in an index fund"" but you can beat the market by owning good companies!

So anyways, I started watching cnbc every single day and studying all the stocks the analysts would mention on the various shows. 

I ended up putting the majority of my money in qqq instead of voo like everyone told me all the time.

Then about 6 years back the only stock they kept talking about day in and day out was nvda!

I said to myself ""heck, if they talk about this stock 24/7 it must be worth throwing some money in!

Long story short, I ended up throwing about 30% of my portfolio at the time in nvda and racked up some huge gains over the years but I didn't sell!

Then about a year ago I said ""eh heck, I gotta diversify more and sold about 18% of my nvda holding, just to be safe.

So now here I an currently sitting at 18% nvda. Here's how I figure out my risk tolerance folks!

I ask myself if nvda went down 50% would my life change. The answer for me is a big NO!

So this is why I'll hold nvda all the way down!

I still believe end of year we see $150!  I can wait no problemo!!  

I still have millions and don't need any money for 20 years when I retire!

Onwards comrades!

Hi!

I‚Äôm curious. Are you invested here? Would you add to your position or trim? The outlook seems weak. What do you think?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Record quarterly revenue of $39.3 billion, up 12% from Q3 and up 78% from a year ago

Record full-year revenue of $130.5 billion, up 114%
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the fourth quarter ended January 26, 2025, of $39.3 billion, up 12% from the previous quarter and up 78% from a year ago.

For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.89, up 14% from the previous quarter and up 82% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.89, up 10% from the previous quarter and up 71% from a year ago.

‚ÄúDemand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law ‚Äî increasing compute for training makes models smarter and increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter,‚Äù said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter. AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.‚Äù

NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on April 2, 2025, to all shareholders of record on March 12, 2025.

Outlook
NVIDIA‚Äôs outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:

Revenue is expected to be $43.0 billion, plus or minus 2%.
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 70.6% and 71.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.
GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17.0%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.

> Trump officials recently met with their Japanese and Dutch counterparts about restricting Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV engineers from maintaining semiconductor gear in China, according to people familiar with the matter. The aim, which was also a priority for Biden, is to see key allies match China curbs the US has placed on American chip-gear companies, including Lam Research Corp., KLA Corp. and Applied Materials Inc. 

> The meetings come in addition to early discussions in Washington about sanctions on specific Chinese companies, other people said. Some Trump officials also aim to further restrict the quantity and type of Nvidia Corp. chips that can be exported to China without a license, said some of the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. 

> The broad goal in Washington is to prevent China from further developing a domestic semiconductor industry that could boost its AI and military capabilities ‚Äî and Trump appears to be picking up where Biden left off. In some areas, that means pursuing agreements with allies that never came to fruition in the prior administration. In others, it means adopting the priorities of the more hawkish members of Biden‚Äôs team, who were unable to build internal consensus on their more aggressive policy aims. 

> It could take months before the talks produce any new US regulations, as Trump makes staffing decisions at key federal agencies. It also remains to be seen whether allies will be more receptive to the new leadership in Washington. The prior administration had reached a handshake agreement with the Hague on limiting gear maintenance in China, but the Dutch demurred after Trump won the election, two senior Biden officials said. Without regular maintenance and servicing, chip-making equipment from ASML and others can quickly lose its ability to meet the rigorous demands of producing semiconductors.

> Biden‚Äôs team also handed off several other priorities to officials on Trump‚Äôs national security council, one of those officials said, and the new team was receptive. One key measure is blocking Chinese memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc. from buying American technology, a step that Biden officials seriously considered but ultimately did not pursue due to opposition from Japan.

> Some officials on Trump‚Äôs team also want to intensify restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., the main chipmaking partner to Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. Biden effectively blocked shipments to some SMIC facilities but established case-by-case review for others, which the officials worry could allow SMIC to purchase tools that are ultimately used at restricted plants. 

> The new administration is also eyeing curbs on sales of chips that Nvidia designed specifically for China, Bloomberg has reported. Some of Biden‚Äôs NSC officials wanted to impose those tighter measures before leaving office, several people said, but then-Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo declined to pursue them.

> Then there‚Äôs the so-called AI diffusion rule, imposed in the final week of Biden‚Äôs term. The measure divided the world into three tiers of countries and set maximum thresholds for the AI computing power that can be shipped to each. It also established mechanisms for companies to validate the security of their projects and access higher compute limits.

> The rule, which will impact data center developments everywhere from Southeast Asia to the Middle East, drew harsh rebuke from companies including Nvidia, where Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang expressed optimism that the Trump administration would opt for a lighter regulatory touch.

> The White House is now seeking to streamline and strengthen that framework, according to several people familiar with the conversations, although what that entails is still in flux.

Under the current restrictions, chipmakers only have to notify the government before exporting the equivalent of as many as 1,700 graphic processing units to most countries. Some Trump officials want to reduce that threshold, people familiar with the matter said, which would expand the scope of the license requirement. 

tldr; Trump's administration is looking to tighten Biden-era restrictions on China‚Äôs semiconductor industry, aiming to curb Beijing‚Äôs technological and military advancements. His team is pressuring allies like Japan and the Netherlands to restrict their engineers from maintaining chip-making equipment in China and considering sanctions on Chinese companies. They also want to further limit Nvidia chip exports and impose stricter controls on SMIC. Trump officials are reviewing Biden‚Äôs AI diffusion rule, with potential changes to reduce the computing power that can be exported without a license."

1ixhqzq,NvidiaStock,This is my final post till earnings. Do with it what you will brethren!,"Ok, so I got made fun of for holding nvda and having a positive outlook for the year at 160 price target.

The gamblers that live home with mommy and work at Door Dash 
(Mostly 20 somethings that think theyve got it all figured out) with $5k portfolios (like I'd worry about ANYTHING... with a $5k portfolio lol) think that a 20% return isn't a good return for one year lol!

They think the average market return is 100% a year.... boy are they gonna be in for a rude awakening lol!

I still maintain that nvda will reach 140 to 150 within a month or so after earnings.  The short term gamblers can't wait 2 months cause they don't have patience and need money for partying now. They'll be broke at 65 living in a trailer park unfortunately.

These people, (like the 95% every 5 years that fail to)  will make less than buying and holding VTI, VOO or qqqm.

1iweouu,NvidiaStock,Nvidia Suppliers Send Mixed Signals for Delays on GB200 Systems ‚Äì What It Means for NVDA Stock,"

Recently Analyst Beth Kindig, a bullish analyst, put out an interesting newsletter that was surprisingly bearish on Nvidia due to their supplier commentary. Earnings on Wednesday should be very interesting. Here‚Äôs a consolidated copy

Super Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target


Super Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.

At Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he ‚Äúexpects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].‚Äù In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect ‚Äú25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.‚Äù

I remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).

Two weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that ‚ÄúDLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months‚Äù -- it‚Äôs not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.

The August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro‚Äôs 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo‚Äôs Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell ‚Äúwill be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.‚Äù

But now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:

Super Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell‚Äôs NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.

Vertiv Signals Softer Q1


Vertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a ‚Äúparticularly strong‚Äù Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.

Vertiv‚Äôs strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell‚Äôs AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the ‚Äúunpredictability of the AI shipments‚Äù as there are ‚Äúsome more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.‚Äù

For Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: ‚ÄúNow of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory‚Äù and also that it is ‚Äúhigher than what we actually saw in 2024.‚Äù

Liquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were ‚Äúon track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.‚Äù

I agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn‚Äôt check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.

Additionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.

My conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.


Networking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s


PCIe 6.0 supplier:

PCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia‚Äôs Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products ‚Äúare driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.‚Äù

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 ‚Äì which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. ‚ÄúNow, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that‚Äôs where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.‚Äù

PMIC Suppliers:

PMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell‚Äôs rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.

One PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that ‚ÄúWe know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.‚Äù

This company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.

The competing PMIC supplier stated: ‚ÄúJust to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.‚Äù

The takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.

Semtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)


Perhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.

Semtech filed an 8-K stating that ‚Äúnet sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company‚Äôs previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.‚Äù

ACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations ‚Äì it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.

The shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly ‚Äúdisrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,‚Äù by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell‚Äôs ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.

While shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it‚Äôs the suddenness that Semtech pulled it‚Äôs guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors ‚Äì the timing of Blackwell‚Äôs launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.

Conclusion:
Given market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.

There is a scenario where Nvidia‚Äôs stock marches higher ‚Äì perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",1740329982.0,thelastsubject123,13,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1iweouu/nvidia_suppliers_send_mixed_signals_for_delays_on/,"Nvidia Suppliers Send Mixed Signals for Delays on GB200 Systems ‚Äì What It Means for NVDA Stock 

Recently Analyst Beth Kindig, a bullish analyst, put out an interesting newsletter that was surprisingly bearish on Nvidia due to their supplier commentary. Earnings on Wednesday should be very interesting. Here‚Äôs a consolidated copy

Super Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target


Super Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.

At Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he ‚Äúexpects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].‚Äù In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect ‚Äú25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.‚Äù

I remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).

Two weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that ‚ÄúDLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months‚Äù -- it‚Äôs not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.

The August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro‚Äôs 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo‚Äôs Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell ‚Äúwill be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.‚Äù

But now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:

Super Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell‚Äôs NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.

Vertiv Signals Softer Q1


Vertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a ‚Äúparticularly strong‚Äù Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.

Vertiv‚Äôs strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell‚Äôs AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the ‚Äúunpredictability of the AI shipments‚Äù as there are ‚Äúsome more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.‚Äù

For Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: ‚ÄúNow of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory‚Äù and also that it is ‚Äúhigher than what we actually saw in 2024.‚Äù

Liquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were ‚Äúon track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.‚Äù

I agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn‚Äôt check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.

Additionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.

My conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.


Networking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s


PCIe 6.0 supplier:

PCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia‚Äôs Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products ‚Äúare driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.‚Äù

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 ‚Äì which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. ‚ÄúNow, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs.

This week is so exciting for me that I most likely won't be sleeping that much this week! I've even ordered myself a cake for earnings night and have decided to take the night off from my cleaning job I do for extra investment money (although I'm worth millions but we always need more  money yo)!

So, as everyone knows my portfolio is about 18% nvda and last Friday we were dealt a blow by the fake bears to try and scare us team!!

I don't worry about bears! To me money is a big joke and I don't care if I lose all my $245 million portfolio! I know I can never lose it all in reality of course, but I don't worry about ""the lost decade"" scare tactics the scared bears are always touting!

Folks, the market is a big scam and I will always repeat this cause it's TRUE! THE market is RIGGED to transfer the middle classes money to the 1%!

The algos are all programmed to get your money when you sell!  This is why ""dead people have the largest portfolios "".... cause they don't look at their portfolios or SELL!! Ever heard the phrase BUY and HOLD and ignore the noise!!??

Team, tonight at 6pm I will be kicking back and watching the futures and this is my favorite time of the weekend! I don't drink or party and I wait for Sunday futures! This is my excitement for the week!

My informed opinion is that nvda is gonna pump after earnings to 145 or more! This is why I didn't sell anything last week friends!! 

Brothers, I've been investing now for over 15 years and the only thing I've done is buy and hold mega caps mostly and I've beat the sp500 by.... wait...... you won't guess...... buying and NEVER SELLING!

Folks, a lot make fun of me , but the way I got rich is mostly luck. My 92 year old grandmother passed and I was left about $145 million from real-estate she co owned and I invested it 15 years ago.  It was easy as pie to almost double it. But I had to sell here and there for a few purchases like a new house and a boat that I take my extended family out on from time  to time.

I live in a modest 1200 sf house and drive a 2009 Honda civic, believe it or not! Mostly, cause I don't want my neighbors knowing I have millions in the bank and a lot of it I can't touch till 59.5 years old!

1itlpy3,NvidiaStock,Is Nvidia Gonna Fall After Earnings Again?,"With the current information I have, I think nvidia's growth is slowing down, and that they're gonna stay conservative to beat earnings. This, paired with their trend of falling on earnings regardless of surprises like during their previous two earnings, is gonna happen again and make the stock dip a few %.

Things to keep in mind :

1. Nvidia is gonna have to address the deepseek impacts, what could they possibly say to deter the fears that AI is getting more efficient to compute? It's not a question of chip performance, it's a question of being able to do the same or more, on less. Deepseek, while clearly did not cost 5.6mln to develop, still came out to have a pricetag that was significantly cheaper than OpenAI's development cost of 20bln (between 1-2bln, on older Nvidia hardware). It's going to get increasingly more difficult to justify their exorbitant prices for their GPUs and chips, margins are going to shrink.

2. Mag7 Capex investments mean multiple companies are going to be coming up with their own chips, while Nvidia still hold the performance lead on theirs, others like AMD could catch up in the future. Furthermore, Microsofts newest quantum chip just knocked the expectations of commercially deploying quantum computing from a couple of decades to a couple of years. While they don't have the production ready yet, they have all the infrastructure online and ready. Nvidia's monopoly is coming to an end faster than we're expecting.

3. Nvidia historically tends to fall on earnings, their previous 2 reports all led to a noticeable drop in share price, even though they were beating their main metrics by a long shot.

> Nvidia is at the forefront of AI discussions, with analysts debating its potential to overcome market downturns and whether it's an AI powerhouse or overhyped. Despite a recent dip, some see it as a buying opportunity, highlighting its long-term potential in the AI sector. However, Nvidia faces challenges, including potential tariffs and competition from Chinese AI models like DeepSeek, which could impact its market share. AMD is also in focus, with some analysts suggesting it remains a worthwhile investment despite being overshadowed by Nvidia. Overall, the sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a focus on Nvidia's long-term growth potential in the AI market, balanced against emerging competitive threats and trade-related uncertainties.

Excerpt from the AI:

> Nvidia is at the forefront of AI discussions, with analysts debating its potential to overcome market downturns and whether it's an AI powerhouse or overhyped. Despite a recent dip, some see it as a buying opportunity, highlighting its long-term potential in the AI sector. However, Nvidia faces challenges, including potential tariffs and competition from Chinese AI models like DeepSeek, which could impact its market share. AMD is also in focus, with some analysts suggesting it remains a worthwhile investment despite being overshadowed by Nvidia. Overall, the sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a focus on Nvidia's long-term growth potential in the AI market, balanced against emerging competitive threats and trade-related uncertainties. Upcoming earnings reports and guidance will be crucial in determining the near-term trajectory of both Nvidia and AMD.

1iq4zza,NvidiaStock,My thesis for why investors shouldn't or should be careful when putting all their eggs in NVDA.,"*Edited for grammatical mistakes due to lack of sleep and rest due to working in multi time zones.

Disclaimer: This is a duplicate post (original was written in response to a fellow investor who questioned my investing opinions on NVDA and US AI companies linked to it.

Disclaimer 2: What I can say without violating my NDA is that the companies and individuals in the know have been preparing their moat and contingencies for NVDA and the US AI companies' eventual drop for almost 24 months now.

Disclaimer 3: The companies my team and I may or may not have done contract work and/or may or may not have been working on this case study for a while now looking for weaknesses in NVDA, the current US AI companies. I have to say this as a precaution for both my team and I, and for anyone who's thinking of using the free DD provided.

Disclaimer 4: Our team has specialities in multiple fields ie economic analysis, international trade, Western, Asian, European and ME gov. policies, studies of ease or barriers to tech transfer, translation of manuals, purchasing, mass tech. adoption, developing markets analysis, etc. Someone or some multinational companies have asked us to compile as much data on the US' AI industry, particularly OpenAI and NVDA, and all companies linked to both.

Here's my thesis, based on some of the contract work but also includes my own personal viewpoints as a pragmatic and value-driven (ie Buffet and late Munger school of thought, but ever slightly risk-driven when and if the necessity to pivot comes.

Bottom line, my team, the people or organizations I work for are more adaptable than Buffet and co).

Feel free to disagree or comment. The more useful discourse provided to the topic at hand is always welcome.

*A word of warning: any idiocy, racist or msygonistic against me or anyone will be reported promptly, and banning from Reddit will be swift.*

*Another word of warning: I was educated and trained in long-form reports and presentation of my and the team's work, so if you millenials and zillenials aren't used to reading, go ahead and use ChatGPT or some other AI to summarize. 

* Last warning: I encourage everyone who reads this thesis to double or quadruple check my thesis for weaknesses, emotional or cognitive bias. Triple check the news linked to the points I'm putting up, and for goodness' sake, don't just rely on MSNBC, Motley or Cramer as your only fact-checking.

Here's my thesis on NVDA and the current US AI companies linked to it:

Everyone agrees that Nvidia chips are highly desirable, and *currently* there aren't any other companies within and outside of the US that can match them, correct?

That's what the fanboys, mass media and 'analysts' on TV and social media have been saying for years now, but do they actually understand or know how far ahead NVDA is in terms of their hardware (chips and robitics) and software really are atm when compared to other companies' *current* offerings or future incoming developments both within the US and internationally?

Yes, I meant developments as in more than one or a few. That is a certainty in all industries, especially in the tech world.

Anyone in the know or rumored to be in the know directly on the AI hardware industry besides Jensen and his superb leather jacket can üíØ answer this better than me (my background's in analytical economics, finance, international trade, markets, gov. policies and some tech), but DeepSeek's huge reveal made a very significant and historic dent on Nvidia's shares.

The painful dent not only affected NVDA's shares, but shares of companies linked to it, which also invested in NVDA, while NVDA also invested in those companies (US AI and tech companies). Make note of this point, which I will explain at the end of my thesis.

Check the available online data for NVDA's investments in other US tech companies and vice versa. The data is available for all to see.

There are many ignorant NVDA fanboys and uneducated analysts (also fanboys with their millions invested in the company and US AI) stating irrational statements before, during and after NVDA's historic loss, and how DeepSeek's R1 was fake, stolen by China's CCP, used NVDA chips, OpenAI's proprietary tech, Jensen's jacket was cloned (sarcastic joke; the jacket is safe, for now) or all sorts of biased statements to comfort themselves or their segments of market.

However, in the world of facts and yes, the markets are always irrational, but the tech industry is still very much functioning on facts last I checked and worked in it, it was a matter of factual, calculated reality that the following happened and will continue to happen at a 97.5 to 100% certainty:

1) Trump 1.0, Biden and Trump 2.0's eventual sanctions against China and the CCP backfired. An interesting case study was Huawei, China's top phone maker that was rumored to have military contracts and CCP links. Whether those were true or false, I cannot comment, but the company was supposed to be crippled by US' sanctions. Guess what, they're stronger now than before tech-wise due to Chinese efficiency, ingenuity and necessity.

The NVDA chips were smuggled through Singapore to China easily to the highest bidder. When there is a will (and lots of $$$), there's a way. Ask yourself this question - where was Jensen during the Trump inauguration? He was in China and Asia.

Huang wants these countries (and basically all nations if possible) to have more share of NVDA's chips because he and NVDA board wants to own more market share of Chinese and Asian AI industry, or else they'll be replaced by some other company that he and those in the know know for certain is already here or incoming.

My educated opinion is Jensen's all about free trade, and I'm almost certain he cares more about AI or AGI advancement for all versus just for the US and their chosen allies. That kind of an entrepreneurial spirit and tech advancement over loyalty to one singular nation is the wildcard #1.

2) DeepSeek's AI was released as open source. How many companies have access to their methods and whatever they learned? Unlimited for the time being. How many companies in China, India, S. Korea, Taiwan, Singaporean, European nations, African nations, and yes, even Russia have access to all that knowledge and possibly tech now? Almost unlimited. That is wildcard #2.

The tech world functions as a collaboration. Remember the early interweb days? Was it collaboration or sanctions that built and pushed the internet to where it is now?

Trust me on this, but the US admins past, current and probably future is living in a bygone era of US being number 1 and American exceptionalism.

I don't get it why this concept is so hard for the US tech and American young investors to understand, but I think the US media, government and probably early education system has something to do with continuing this fallacy.

3) One stone by DeepSeek r1 caused NVDA's historic fall; how many other companies does China, India, some European, and yes, even American companies does it need to collapse the company or worse, US' AI industry as a whole? Does anyone outside of Jensen and co. knows how big of a moat Nvidia has to sustain themselves when, not if that happens in the very near future?

4) How many nations in the world right now would love to take a huge swing at DJT, Trump 2.0's administration and yes, even the mighty US oligarchs while Trump's tariff wars is ongoing? Last check was at least 5, and the list is and will increase under Trump and Musk.

That is wildcard #3 because when trade or politics become personal, the market heads into very uncertain territories, and spending on tech becomes highly irrational. Where's Tesla now?

China is staying strangely quiet (quieter than Trump 1.0's reign and tariffs), and knowing Xi, CCP's history, and also some of my team and my personal experience living and working in the region before, a quiet China means a hardworking and busy state, meaning, even more focus and resources pushed to development of AI and tech supremacy to counter outside threats (Trump, his successors and possibly eventually Putin) and to have tech supremacy over all of the countries in the region of South China sea and beyond. That is a certainty, and the CCP has made it so.

That beyond part kept my team and I up at many a nights, and as a Western-educated individual who lived a huge part of life in the Northern hemisphere, I wouldn't want any single country or bloc to rule over the entire world.

That gives way to another Axis regime, and my people and ancestors have suffered hard under the British empire, imperial Japan, Nazi Germany and also the Americans' interference of divide and conquer for far too long. Too many lives and generational wealth have been lost to history.

5) Add all that up together (plus some other proprietary points and research my sources and contractors in private and public wealth management multinationals that I don't have the right to give out due to ongoing NDAs).

Finally, what do you as a sensible investor think will happen to NVDA and all the companies linked to it in the Western hemisphere, if even one more DeepSeek-like company comes up in the very near future, or worse, hundreds to thousands of smaller, more mobile and adaptable companies rides from what was done, and one of US AI companies right now falls?

What do you think will happen to the markets, Western tech and AI industry and their billions invested? What will happen to all of the so-called dumb money invested in those companies or companies linked to them or NVDA?

Disclaimer: This is a duplicate post (original was written in response to a fellow investor who questioned my investing opinions on NVDA and US AI companies linked to it.

Disclaimer 2: What I can say without violating my NDA is that the companies and individuals in the know have been preparing their moat and contingencies for NVDA and the US AI companies' eventual drop for almost 24 months now.

Disclaimer 3: The companies my team and I may or may not have done contract work and/or may or may not have been working on this case study for a while now looking for weaknesses in NVDA, the current US AI companies. I have to say this as a precaution for both my team and I, and for anyone who's thinking of using the free DD provided.

Disclaimer 4: Our team has specialities in multiple fields ie economic analysis, international trade, Western, Asian, European and ME gov. policies, studies of ease or barriers to tech transfer, translation of manuals, purchasing, mass tech. adoption, developing markets analysis, etc. Someone or some multinational companies have asked us to compile as much data on the US' AI industry, particularly OpenAI and NVDA, and all companies linked to both.

Here's my thesis, based on some of the contract work but also includes my own personal viewpoints as a pragmatic and value-driven (ie Buffet and late Munger school of thought, but ever slightly risk-driven when and if the necessity to pivot comes.

Bottom line, my team, the people or organizations I work for are more adaptable than Buffet and co).

Feel free to disagree or comment. The more useful discourse provided to the topic at hand is always welcome.

Here's my thesis on NVDA and the current US AI companies linked to it:

Everyone agrees that Nvidia chips are highly desirable, and *currently* there aren't any other companies within and outside of the US that can match them, correct?

That's what the fanboys, mass media and 'analysts' on TV and social media have been saying for years now, but do they actually understand or know how far ahead NVDA is in terms of their hardware (chips and robitics) and software really are atm when compared to other companies' *current* offerings or future incoming developments both within the US and internationally?

Yes, I meant developments as in more than one or a few. That is a certainty in all industries, especially in the tech world.

Anyone in the know or rumored to be in the know directly on the AI hardware industry besides Jensen and his superb leather jacket can üíØ answer this better than me (my background's in analytical economics, finance, international trade, markets, gov. policies and some tech), but DeepSeek's huge reveal made a very significant and historic dent on Nvidia's shares.

The painful dent not only affected NVDA's shares, but shares of companies linked to it, which also invested in NVDA, while NVDA also invested in those companies (US AI and tech companies). Make note of this point, which I will explain at the end of my thesis.

1iou10j,NvidiaStock,"My portfolio up 10% ytd, 28% 1 yr, and 122% last 5 years. Thanks nvda!","Buying and holding  is how I easily beat the sp500 the last 15 years. There's no magic involved! I don't look at fundamentals,  or anything. I simply buy mega caps at reasonable prices and then I don't sell.

I hold anywhere from 5% to most of the time 20% cash and I STILL beat or match qqq for the last 10 years!

I mostly only hold up to 5% in each stock and a few stocks are more than that. I don't worry or care about mega cap fundamentals cause to me they're mostly invincible!

I just achieved a new ath today. If I had sat in voo the last 15 years, I'd have reduced returns, but that's what most people should be doing! NOT picking stocks!

I only hold NO BRAINER stocks that ALWAYS go up over 5 and 10 years. Stocks like COST LIN MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA etc!

I do gamble on a few stocks like CRWD RDDT HOOD MSTR etc, BUT I keep them to under 2 or so % of my portfolio.

I also have another portfolio that is only QQQ and VTI and I don't do individual stocks in that, save for 10% NVDA and some LLY.

Anyways, instead of trading in and out and trying to make short term profits, most people should be buying and never selling till they retire!

EVERY stock I've sold, was much higher 2 years later!  Think about that!

I scooped up more nvda on the recent sell down to 115, when everyone was panicking saying ""dude,  I'll buy at $100 or $90!!""  You can't think like that! The pros nibble,  a little at a time on dips!

I scooped up a lot at 115, BUT I still had and still do, almost 20% cash in case it DOES drop some day!  I NEVER  deploy all my cash UNLESS we sell off 10 to 20%, then maybe I'd go all in, save for maybe 5% cash.  I love cash! And I'm payed 4% in my money market while I wait.

When nvda hit $115 I KNEW that it would never stay that low!!  Sure, it could've gone to 100 or 90, no one can ever be 100% sure, BUT I asked myself if I though nvda would never  return to 140 ever again.... my intuition told me THAT was ridiculous for such a company and so I loaded the boat in my roth Ira!

This is the way to make money folks! NOT gambling on options and trying to jump in and out of positions!

1ik1wy8,NvidiaStock,Nvidia / Coreweave - AI Deep Dive,"# CoreWeave and NVIDIA: An Investigative Deep Dive Into Possible Conflicts of Interest and Market Manipulation

# Introduction: The Perfect AI Storm or a Dangerous Financial Bubble?

NVIDIA ($NVDA) has positioned itself as the dominant supplier of high-performance GPUs, driving the AI revolution with its cutting-edge chips. At the same time, a lesser-known but rapidly growing player, CoreWeave, has emerged as a critical customer and partner of NVIDIA. CoreWeave, a cloud computing startup, transitioned from crypto mining into AI infrastructure, seemingly at the perfect moment, right as demand for AI exploded.

But beneath the surface of this relationship lies a tangled web of financial interdependencies, potential conflicts of interest, and an alarming pattern of debt-financed GPU speculation. Investigating these relationships raises questions about whether NVIDIA and CoreWeave are engaged in a mutually beneficial partnership‚Äîor if their dealings represent a systemic risk to financial markets and a potential case of market manipulation.

# The Rapid Rise of CoreWeave and Its Deep Ties to NVIDIA

CoreWeave was founded in 2017 as a cryptocurrency mining operation, riding the boom and bust cycle of blockchain technology. However, when crypto prices crashed, the company pivoted to AI and cloud computing‚Äîa move that positioned it to become one of the biggest private buyers of NVIDIA‚Äôs most advanced GPUs.

* **CoreWeave‚Äôs primary business model revolves around NVIDIA‚Äôs high-end AI chips.** It rents out cloud-based access to these GPUs, allowing AI developers and businesses to train models without having to buy the hardware themselves.
* **CoreWeave has received direct investments from NVIDIA, making its independence questionable.** NVIDIA took a stake in the company as part of its strategic expansion into AI infrastructure.
* **CoreWeave has aggressively secured billions in debt financing‚Äîusing NVIDIA GPUs as collateral.** This means that NVIDIA‚Äôs own hardware is not just a product for CoreWeave but an asset class that backs financial deals.

What makes this particularly troubling is that NVIDIA profits from both sides of this arrangement: it sells GPUs to CoreWeave, which increases demand for its products, and it also benefits from the financialization of these chips as collateral in debt markets.

# The Debt-Fueled Expansion: A House of Cards?

In 2023, CoreWeave secured a **$2.3 billion debt facility**, using NVIDIA‚Äôs flagship **H100 GPUs** as collateral. This move effectively created a **speculative asset market for NVIDIA chips**, allowing private investors and hedge funds to place financial bets on the continued rise of AI demand.

However, this strategy raises major red flags:

1. **Artificially Inflated Demand:** By providing billions in loans against NVIDIA chips, CoreWeave and its lenders create artificial demand. If AI workloads slow down or demand for GPUs decreases, these loans could quickly turn into distressed assets.
2. **Circular Dependency:** NVIDIA benefits from CoreWeave‚Äôs purchases, but CoreWeave‚Äôs financial health is entirely dependent on NVIDIA‚Äôs continued success. If CoreWeave struggles to service its debt, the resale value of these GPUs would plummet, exposing NVIDIA to risks as well.
3. **Speculative Leverage:** The use of debt to finance technology expansion isn‚Äôt new, but the scale and structure of these deals resemble patterns seen in past financial crises‚Äîwhere assets are used as collateral to take on increasing amounts of leverage.

**Are we witnessing an AI-driven GPU bubble?** Some analysts believe so. The hype around AI is undeniable, but if the industry cools, the financialized nature of CoreWeave‚Äôs NVIDIA-backed debts could create a cascading effect‚Äîleading to significant losses for investors.

# CoreWeave‚Äôs Explosive Valuation Growth: Too Fast, Too Questionable?

In **less than two years, CoreWeave‚Äôs valuation skyrocketed from $2 billion to $23 billion.** This meteoric rise raises concerns about whether the company‚Äôs fundamentals truly justify such an increase, or if speculation and NVIDIA‚Äôs influence have played a role.

Consider these factors:

* **NVIDIA‚Äôs ownership stake in CoreWeave gives it a vested interest in inflating its value.** Investors should question whether NVIDIA‚Äôs stake has influenced bullish projections on CoreWeave‚Äôs worth.
* **CoreWeave has no proprietary technology that differentiates it.** Unlike Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, CoreWeave‚Äôs primary selling point is its access to NVIDIA GPUs‚Äîessentially acting as a middleman.
* **CoreWeave‚Äôs financing structure depends on favorable market conditions.** With interest rates rising and AI demand fluctuating, the sustainability of its debt-based expansion is far from guaranteed.

If CoreWeave‚Äôs valuation is being propped up by speculative financial arrangements and NVIDIA‚Äôs influence, we could be looking at one of the biggest AI-related bubbles yet.

# Market Manipulation and Potential Regulatory Issues

# Is NVIDIA Using CoreWeave to Boost Its Own Market Position?

Given NVIDIA‚Äôs dominant position in AI chips, any sign of market manipulation should be carefully examined. The following concerns stand out:

1. **Shadow Demand for NVIDIA Chips:** By directing supply to CoreWeave, NVIDIA ensures continued high demand for its GPUs, keeping prices elevated and stock valuations high.
2. **Concentration Risk:** Unlike diversified cloud providers, CoreWeave relies almost exclusively on NVIDIA‚Äôs hardware, raising concerns about competitive neutrality.
3. **Debt-Backed Ponzi Risk:** If AI demand falters, and CoreWeave‚Äôs lenders start demanding repayment, the company could face liquidity issues‚Äîleading to a fire sale of GPUs that could crash NVIDIA‚Äôs market value.

# Regulatory Scrutiny Is Likely on the Horizon

Given the staggering debt-financed growth of CoreWeave and its ties to NVIDIA, regulatory agencies such as the **SEC and the FTC** may take interest in the following:

* **Anti-Competitive Practices:** Is NVIDIA using its stake in CoreWeave to create an unfair advantage in the cloud computing space?
* **Financial Market Manipulation:** Are the GPU-backed loans creating artificial demand that benefits NVIDIA‚Äôs stock price while introducing systemic financial risks?
* **Debt Transparency Issues:** Are investors and lenders fully aware of the risks associated with using hardware as collateral for billion-dollar loans?

Regulators have already taken a keen interest in the AI and semiconductor sectors. If CoreWeave‚Äôs growth turns out to be unsustainable, it could spark a broader investigation into NVIDIA‚Äôs business practices.

# Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Stakes AI Gamble

The CoreWeave-NVIDIA relationship represents **one of the most intricate and high-risk financial arrangements in the AI industry today.** What appears on the surface to be a simple supplier-customer dynamic is, in reality, a complex web of **financialized hardware speculation, debt-backed market manipulation, and potential anti-competitive behavior.**

While NVIDIA remains one of the most valuable tech companies in the world, its interdependence with CoreWeave raises significant red flags. If CoreWeave stumbles under the weight of its own debt, NVIDIA may find itself facing not just financial repercussions, but regulatory scrutiny that could reshape the AI infrastructure landscape.

**Investors should watch this space closely.** The next financial crisis may not come from real estate or banking‚Äîbut from the high-stakes, debt-fueled world of AI computing.",1738952830.0,TheKentMug,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1ik1wy8/nvidia_coreweave_ai_deep_dive/,"Nvidia / Coreweave - AI Deep Dive # CoreWeave and NVIDIA: An Investigative Deep Dive Into Possible Conflicts of Interest and Market Manipulation

And I think most forget that with NVDA in light of the DEepseek stuff and all the weak sentiment around the stock: Nvidia continues to execute on the highest level.¬†

And Nvidia has 95% market share of the data center GPU market right now. That is incredible.

Now I think a lot was made of the fact that META last week mentioned that they wanted to move towards AVGO's ASIC chips. And that does represent a headwind to Nvidia, but the saying is when one door closes, another opens.

The idea is that Coreweave has launched the first Nvidia GB200 NVL72-based instances, marking the first general availability of the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. The launch aims to meet the increasing demand for massive compute and optimized software to scale AI reasoning models and agents.

1ihlrxl,NvidiaStock,DeepSeek: These 2 stocks are 'clear winners' from increased inference use cases,"Article :

Piper Sandler analysts identified Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company as the ""clear winners"" from the growing demand for inference compute power, driven by the increasing use of AI applications.

Following discussions with a data center engineering expert, the firm‚Äôs analysts reiterated their belief that AI infrastructure spending will continue rising. 

""Compute and further capex requirements are only increasing as inference applications for LLMs continue to proliferate,"" the expert noted.

While DeepSeek‚Äôs advancements have made headlines, Piper said the expert believes leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic remain six months ahead.

One of the key takeaways from the discussion was that inference, rather than training, is becoming the dominant cost driver for AI labs. 

""Inferencing, which is the monetization engine for most of these labs, is what drives the capex up and there are no shortcuts associated with inference compute deployments,"" the expert told Piper.

Currently, OpenAI and Anthropic allocate about 75% of their compute resources to inference, but this is expected to increase to 90% as training requirements stabilize.

The analyst note emphasizes that Nvidia is best positioned to capitalize on this shift. ""According to our expert, NVDA followed by TSMC are the clear winners for capex dedicated to inferencing."" 

The report also highlights that networking, particularly optical solutions, will play a crucial role in supporting this trend.

Despite the excitement surrounding DeepSeek, analysts found its cost efficiency claims less impressive when compared to OpenAI. 

""A similar run on OpenAI would have cost somewhere in the $10 million range, thereby making the DeepSeek training run cost not so impressive relative to the U.S. comps,"" the expert noted.

With inference applications rapidly expanding, analysts remain bullish on Nvidia and TSMC as key beneficiaries of AI's continued evolution.",1738686836.0,Far-Pomelo-6581,13,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1ihlrxl/deepseek_these_2_stocks_are_clear_winners_from/,"DeepSeek: These 2 stocks are 'clear winners' from increased inference use cases Article :

1ih318f,NvidiaStock,SMCI Earnings 2/11/25 and History,"NEWS: HPC-AI server stock SMCI announces business update for 2/11/25. After last earnings call, I can see NVDA B200 GPU's releasing Q1 2025 and liquid servers leading to high 2025 projections for SMCI. Updates on 10-K filings being on track would also build confidence. Details below:

Compared to its 52 week high of $122.90, SMCI is still trading at a 76% discount of $29.50. So how did it get so low and what's in store for SMCI from here on out?

1. On 8/28/24, Hindenberg released its short report right after NVDA went down 7% after earnings due to FUD concerning their massive growth was unsustainable (which turned out to be plain wrong). Before this, SMCI and NVDA mirrored each other's price changes.
2. Following this in September 2024, the DOJ released a report that led to a 10% drop that was quickly bought back up to original stock price in 2 weeks.
3. The drop that actually mattered was the one in October 2024 confirming accountant E&Y backed out. This has been priced in and is the big question mark. BDO is the new accounting firm and 10-K is due 2/25.
4. In my opinion, SMCI may have fudged numbers a bit like making deliveries early to meet earnings goals. This is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from pretending there are no orders to begin with.
5. After getting an extension by nasdaq to file their 10-K which led to a rally up to $50 early December, the market wide EOY sell off following HPC-AI FUD from DeepSeek led to the price decline we see today.
6. On 1/29/25, SMCI chief accounting officer Kenneth Cheung accepted stock options which may indicate confidence in timely submission of 10-K forms.

As you may summize, SMCI price is low mainly due to FUD concerning the integrity of its numbers. It has huge partnerships with NVDA, GOOGL, AMZN and xai and its server business has high demand. Earnings goal for SMCI will be to restore its reputation.

1ighbtx,NvidiaStock,Why are you worried that Nvidia is red today or this week?,"If there were no buyers purchasing the selloff, there wouldn't be any red. So it is important to understand why these sellers are selling and why these buyers are buying.

If one answers these questions, one will realize that a red day, week, or even month should not matter to you. If it does matter to you, then you are investing incorrectly, you putting yourself in a disadvantage. 

1. What is the reason sellers are selling off?


2. Why would a buyer purchase the selloff? If the buyer thought like the seller, they wouldn‚Äôt have bought the selloff, right? So there must be a good reason.


3. If the buyer has a good reason to buy the selloff, then why are you worried about it being red?



The paradox here is that every trade requires both a buyer and a seller, but motivations and strategies differ. Some are forced sellers (due to margin calls, stop losses, or fund liquidations), while others are opportunistic buyers. The market‚Äôs overall trend depends on whether fear-driven selling overwhelms strategic buying.

Damn, today was brutal. NVIDIA just got absolutely crushed, and it feels like a punch to the gut. TBH! I'm sweating & worried & feels that the end is near, losing hope, I bought at $134, as I'm holding some heavy bags.

However, these diamond hands ain't selling anything in loss. The market's being a total drama queen right now, thanks to ü•≠. Governments will do their thing with tariffs, news cycles will spin, but AI? That's the real deal, however the risk of successful implementation is always looming.

NVIDIA isn't just another tech company - they're basically building the infrastructure for the next technological revolution. I still think that people are not realizing how important $NVDA is to the AI eco system. These short-term dips? Just noise.

My call options are looking rough right now, not gonna lie. But I'm not averaging down on them, unless I am profitable from other trades.

The FUD merchants can spread all the negativity they want. Doesn't change the fact that NVIDIA is sitting on a goldmine of AI potential. üöÄüöÄüöÄ  
These chips are going to be powering everything from autonomous vehicles, robotics, AI to medical research & what not. Hold, do not sell in loss & try not to FOMO.

Bottom line: Don't bet the farm, but don't run scared either. Stay disciplined, keep some powder dry, and remember - the market is a marathon, not a sprint. Pace yourself, live to die another day, don't lose out all on options, if you have option gains then take them & invest them in shares. ü•≠ will make the markets volatile than it should be, make wise decisions.

Lastly, If you are feeling too stressed out, don't worry, things will be fine eventually... Take a break.. Listen to music... Take a walk... Spend some time in nature... Smoke a doobie! Watch a movie... Have fun & stay safe!

1ies0dk,NvidiaStock,The Short Case For Nvidia - Worth A Read,"My fav part: So what was the catalyst that caused Nvidia to crash on Monday? Emanuel has another theory that could help explain it.

He pointed to the fact that so many people in San Jose were reading his blog post. He theorized that many of them were Nvidia employees with thousands ‚Äî or even millions ‚Äî of dollars worth of Nvidia stock tied up in employee stock options. With that much money in a single asset, Emanuel speculated that many were already debating whether to hold the stock or sell it to lock in profits. He believes his blog post helped convince some of them to sell.

‚ÄúA lot of the sell pressure you saw on Monday morning wasn‚Äôt necessarily what you might think. I believe a fair amount of that was from shares that had never been active because they had been sitting in workplace.schwab.com accounts ‚Äî \[restricted stock units\] that employees got in some cases back in 2003 for nothing,‚Äù Emanuel told MarketWatch. ‚ÄúThat makes a big difference because everything‚Äôs on the margin, and shares that have never moved.‚Äù

It may be hard to prove for certain that Emanuel‚Äôs post influenced Nvidia employees to sell, but the fact that it went viral on X among the Silicon Valley tech community, and that so many readers were based in San Jose, makes his case plausible. Still, it‚Äôs worth taking this theory with a grain of salt.

1iel61m,NvidiaStock,Cramer makes a call on Nvidia (jailbreaking a paidwall article),"I'm posting something that's behind his paid wall, some things to keep in mind:

* His charitable trust owns 1050 shares at $15.40 cost basis. It makes up 3.55% of his charitable trust portfolio (it's in the top 7)
* He always calls Nvidia ""own it but don't trade it"" -- I think the only other stock he says that about often is Apple.
* He didn't have a knee jerk reaction to Deep Seek. He said live on TV that he doesn't know and need time to think about this.
* Some people in the media will spin this as ""OMG Nvidia's biggest fan just sold some shares."" That would be an exaggeration. 
* Bottomline he's still bullish on Nvdia but recognizes it might be time to take some profit off the table, just a little bit. But keep in mind that might not be the right move for you. His cost basis is **FIFTEEN DOLLARS**. It makes sense to take at least A LITTLE off the table.

The [paidwalled article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/cramer-tough-call-on-nvidia-after-watching-it-get-pummeled-this-week.html) (emphasis mine):

What to do with Nvidia after a terrible week?

* Nvidia has been a huge winner for the Club ‚Äî and, deservedly so. The company is behind the two most important trends in tech: accelerated computing and generative artificial intelligence. For that, it has been rewarded with, at one time, the largest valuation in the world. Even after this week, it‚Äôs still among the top three with a market capitalization of more than $2.9 trillion.

* We have embraced Nvidia like no other. And, we‚Äôve embraced it for years. But, when it got to be too big in the portfolio at the start of this year, we trimmed it, pretty much at the high. Remember, Nvidia surged more than 170% in 2024 following a nearly 240% surge in 2023.

* Now we have a Chinese startup DeepSeek that may cause some Nvidia customers to pause their ordering of the company‚Äôs latest chips, which are quite expensive, especially for the new Blackwell platform. But the pricing has much to do with Nvidia‚Äôs dominant status. There are several companies, **customers of Nvidia, that know if they want to be the leaders in AI they must pay full freight**, including Meta Platforms. Tesla hinted that it, too, must order hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips to run the neural networks needed to power full self-driving electric vehicles.

* Most companies ‚Äî and countries, also big customers ‚Äî will want to **question their spending for accelerated computing** and generative AI after what they have read about the Chinese invention from DeepSeek. Nvidia shares are **priced for the language that CEO Jensen Huang said about the demand** that there is an insane amount of it.

* It may, however, **take only one large customer** to say it is pausing to cut Nvidia stock down maybe another 10%. Shares of the AI chipmaker are already down 16% week to date on DeepSeek concerns, which has reversed a modest gain for 2025 as of last Friday close to a 10% year-to-date decline not even a week later.

* That potential pause calls into question the valuation of Nvidia, and that‚Äôs something we cannot ignore. While believing **Nvidia should still be ‚Äúowned, not traded‚Äù** that does not give us license to turn a blind eye to a change in the facts. We can own Nvidia, of that there is no question. But to own this amount of Nvidia, to me, is to ignore the possibility that tech customers will pause or bargain with Nvidia for better pricing or seek out less powerful chips from Advanced Micro Devices

* Bottom line Therefore, I believe we need to make the position smaller, given that it is priced, even here, for perfection, and the story is no longer perfect. The position is still too big in the portfolio relative to the stock‚Äôs gains and market capitalization accumulation over the past few years. Sure, by trimming we could give up some of our upside should it recover. However, discipline demands making a sale to shield us from losses in case our worst fears are realized.

1ieimgg,NvidiaStock,THEORY - Trump to Invoke the DPA on Nvidia,"Trump is meeting with Nvidia today, and I‚Äôm calling it now:¬†**he's gonna invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) on NVDA.**

# THE SIGNS ARE TOO OBVIOUS

1. **Trump just nuked Biden‚Äôs AI regulations**¬†‚Äì That‚Äôs right, he just axed Biden‚Äôs executive order on AI risks ([link here](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/trump-revokes-biden-executive-order-addressing-ai-risks-2025-01-21/)). Why? Because AI is the new nuclear arms race, and the U.S. needs to go full send.
2. **Nvidia is the only game in town**¬†‚Äì Jensen Huang basically prints AI dominance. The world is bending the knee to NVDA, and if China is coming for the AI throne, the U.S. can't afford to let its golden goose wander off.
3. **Trump loves trade war power moves**¬†‚Äì What better way to flex on China than to seize NVDA‚Äôs chip production under the DPA, prioritize U.S. manufacturing, and force Jensen to crank out H100s for America first?
4. **Military implications are too juicy**¬†‚Äì The Pentagon is all over this for battlefield dominance.

# THE SIGNS ARE TOO OBVIOUS

1. **Trump just nuked Biden‚Äôs AI regulations**¬†‚Äì That‚Äôs right, he just axed Biden‚Äôs executive order on AI risks ([link here](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/trump-revokes-biden-executive-order-addressing-ai-risks-2025-01-21/)). Why? Because AI is the new nuclear arms race, and the U.S. needs to go full send.
2. **Nvidia is the only game in town**¬†‚Äì Jensen Huang basically prints AI dominance. The world is bending the knee to NVDA, and if China is coming for the AI throne, the U.S. can't afford to let its golden goose wander off.
3. **Trump loves trade war power moves**¬†‚Äì What better way to flex on China than to seize NVDA‚Äôs chip production under the DPA, prioritize U.S. manufacturing, and force Jensen to crank out H100s for America first?
4. **Military implications are too juicy**¬†‚Äì The Pentagon is all over this for battlefield dominance.

1idsqni,NvidiaStock,Why the Tech Panic Sell Is Overblown: A Concrete Example,"Building a one- or two-story house? Wood does the job, and at a lower cost. But if you want to build a 30-story skyscraper, you‚Äôd better start with concrete.



It‚Äôs the same with tech. The data centers hosting NVIDIA‚Äôs GPUs aren‚Äôt just warehouses filled with processors. They are cathedrals of computing, designed to absorb exponential technological growth.



DeepSeek and the Material Analogy



DeepSeek, the Chinese company developing AI models, recently made headlines for using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, which are less advanced than the H100 or B200 chips that dominate the market.



It‚Äôs like building an entire high-rise with standard concrete, even though you know high-performance concrete would allow you to build faster and taller. It might be cheaper and more efficient in the short term, but it severely limits future scalability.



The reality is that AI is pushing GPU demand to new extremes. Today, some models are trained on tens of thousands of GPUs, and each new generation makes older chips obsolete faster than expected.



The Law of Technological Accelerators



Until recently, computing power followed Moore‚Äôs Law (doubling every 18-24 months). But with AI, we are now seeing what some call Huang‚Äôs Law, where computing power multiplies up to 1,000 times faster due to GPU advancements and AI architecture improvements.


Some numbers to illustrate this phenomenon:

 ‚Ä¢ The generative AI market is expected to grow from $8 billion in 2023 to over $100 billion by 2028.

 ‚Ä¢ Storage demand is skyrocketing, driven by the exponential increase in data volumes.

 ‚Ä¢ Cloud computing, AI models, and big data processing require infrastructures built not for yearly upgrades, but for decades of sustained growth.

Wood does the job, and at a lower cost. But if you want to build a 30-story skyscraper, you‚Äôd better start with concrete.



It‚Äôs the same with tech. The data centers hosting NVIDIA‚Äôs GPUs aren‚Äôt just warehouses filled with processors. They are cathedrals of computing, designed to absorb exponential technological growth.



DeepSeek and the Material Analogy



DeepSeek, the Chinese company developing AI models, recently made headlines for using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, which are less advanced than the H100 or B200 chips that dominate the market.



It‚Äôs like building an entire high-rise with standard concrete, even though you know high-performance concrete would allow you to build faster and taller. It might be cheaper and more efficient in the short term, but it severely limits future scalability.



The reality is that AI is pushing GPU demand to new extremes. Today, some models are trained on tens of thousands of GPUs, and each new generation makes older chips obsolete faster than expected.



The Law of Technological Accelerators



Until recently, computing power followed Moore‚Äôs Law (doubling every 18-24 months). But with AI, we are now seeing what some call Huang‚Äôs Law, where computing power multiplies up to 1,000 times faster due to GPU advancements and AI architecture improvements.


Some numbers to illustrate this phenomenon:

 ‚Ä¢ The generative AI market is expected to grow from $8 billion in 2023 to over $100 billion by 2028.

 ‚Ä¢ Storage demand is skyrocketing, driven by the exponential increase in data volumes.

 ‚Ä¢ Cloud computing, AI models, and big data processing require infrastructures built not for yearly upgrades, but for decades of sustained growth.

1idnevb,NvidiaStock,Pre earnings pump?,"Just like the last 2 earnings NVDA has dumped a month before earnings. Last summer was as bad as this time, last fall wasn't as bad. Now that meta and MSFT confirmed no reduction on expected capex and now that it seems that deep seek might be bullish for NVDA (easier to make AI profitable = more people will want to invest), do you think we'll start pumping in anticipation of earnings soon?

Here are a few reasons I'm optimistic:
1. After the dump to 90s last summer NVDA went from 99 on Aug 7 to 130 on Aug 20, in 2 weeks. So we know such pumps are possible for such company.
2. This quarter we'll see Blackwell revenue numbers, which have been quoted to be ""a few billion, maybe more"". Don't remember who said that.
3. In the last 1 year, NVDA has hit new ATHs or gotten close to previous ATHs before earnings.
4. Sure, with improvements on models like deep seek did some companies can use worse chips for decent results, but the richest companies will want the best chips and if NVDA loses some customers, the demand will just go elsewhere, so many want NVDA's chips. US companies, Dubai, other countries. And even if demand drops later, NVDA is sold out for the year as far as I know so this year, we'll see more and more profit each quarter unless supply chain faces issues.
5. Last year, profitability was a concern for us NVDA holders. We worried that if companies have a hard time showing profit from AI, but with deep seeks improvements that should be easier. So I'm a way this sounds like good news from NVDA.

1ic2czm,NvidiaStock,Taking a bet the current administration will ban DeepSeek,"# Reasons for Potential Ban or Restrictions

1. **State Sponsorship and Influence:**
   * **DeepSeek** being state-sponsored means the Chinese government could have direct or indirect influence over the outputs, data collection, and behavior of the models.
   * Concerns over propaganda, misinformation campaigns, or even backdoor access to sensitive data could drive regulatory action in the U.S.
2. **Data Privacy Concerns:**
   * If U.S. citizens or businesses use the platform, there‚Äôs a risk that sensitive data could be stored or accessed by the Chinese government under laws like China's **Cybersecurity Law** or **Data Security Law**, which compel companies to share data with the state.
3. **Precedent with Chinese Technologies:**
   * The U.S. has previously restricted or banned technologies like **Huawei**, **TikTok** (in certain states and organizations), and **DJI drones** due to concerns about espionage, surveillance, and influence operations.
   * **AI models**, particularly those as powerful as DeepSeek, represent a new frontier for those same concerns.
4. **Geopolitical AI Race:**
   * As AI becomes central to economic and military dominance, the U.S. may want to protect its own AI industry by limiting foreign competitors like DeepSeek from gaining a foothold.
5. **Misinformation Threats:**
   * Unchecked Chinese LLMs could spread tailored misinformation or manipulate public opinion in ways that align with Chinese state interests, a significant concern given the influence of LLMs.

# Likely Steps for Restriction

1. **Export and Import Controls**:
   * The U.S. government might block access to DeepSeek‚Äôs APIs or software under rules similar to the **Entity List**, as it has done with Huawei and others.
2. **Geofencing or Platform Restrictions**:
   * Major tech platforms (e.g., Apple, Google, Microsoft) could be required to geofence or remove access to DeepSeek‚Äôs services from U.S. territories.
3. **Data Localization Laws**:
   * The U.S. could pass laws that ban the transfer of data to foreign-owned LLMs or require strict compliance measures that make DeepSeek unappealing to U.S. businesses.
4. **Sanctions**:
   * Companies developing or distributing state-sponsored AI like DeepSeek could be sanctioned, cutting them off from partnerships, cloud infrastructure, or other resources in the U.S.

# Implications of a Ban

1. **Economic Impact**:
   * Businesses in the U.S. might lose access to cost-effective and competitive AI tools, potentially increasing dependency on more expensive domestic alternatives.
2. **Escalation of AI Nationalism**:
   * A ban would further fuel the divide in the global AI landscape, with the U.S. and allies on one side and China leading an alternative ecosystem.
3. **Push for Regulation**:
   * This could accelerate regulatory frameworks in the U.S. to govern AI development and usage more strictly, especially for foreign providers.
4. **Tech Cold War**:
   * Restricting DeepSeek would further solidify the ""AI Cold War"" between the U.S. and China, with increased focus on self-reliance and alliances for AI development.

**TLDR:** Nvidia will still be market leader. Buy at a deep discount. These prices won't last long especially when Trump says he is going to ban Chinese AI.

My service is not affected when Chat-GPT is down or Claude is down or for that matter even AWS is down. I control my own destiny because the models are mine and they are made for retail investors.

I think I have built something very powerful for US based Retail Investors where they can ask any stock market related question and it would respond accurately in sub-5 secs after going through earning call, news, SEC filings, Financial statements etc including

* Find companies based on metrics and latest data in plain english
   * Top 5¬†Space exploration¬†sector companies based on revenues
   * Which companies are trading near their¬†52-week highs\*?\*
   * Which companies have exceeded their analyst EPS estimates for the last three consecutive quarters and a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio below 2?
* Research about any company
   * AMZN
   * What is the fair value of Costco?
   * What are the¬†latest GPU launches¬†by Nvidia?
* Analyze earning calls, latest news, cash flow statement, income statement etc based on your question
   * Summarize Earning call of Nvidia
   * Analyze income statement of amazon with special emphasis on profitability

All of this is completely¬†free, with no sign-ups, no waitlists, and no credit card requirements. Plus, you get to ask unlimited questions without constraints imposed by Chat-GPT, Claude etc.

Meticulously curated financial data, ingested \~200k+ SEC filings across last decade and more than 1000 PDFs of top finance books across investing, trading etc. It took 10+ iterations, multiple model trainings and 24+ months to arrive at where I am and finally felt vindicated to see that ""Deep Pockets i.e OpenAI or Nvidia"" doesn't always win and there is space for new comers.

This post is a response to people who always say that ""You are¬†**just**¬†a chat-GPT wrapper"" and let me be very clear that no I am not. My service is not affected when Chat-GPT is down or Claude is down or for that matter even AWS is down. I control my own destiny because the models are mine and they are made for retail investors. I don't show any ads, don't make any money out of it, don't ask for any login/signup/credit card or put an artificial cutoff of 5 questions because¬†***""Hey, I have made it for Retail investors with all my heart and soul and I want them to use it"".***

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now comes the product promotion part, Link in comments.

I think I have built something very powerful for US based Retail Investors where they can ask any stock market related question and it would respond accurately in sub-5 secs after going through earning call, news, SEC filings, Financial statements etc including

* Find companies based on metrics and latest data in plain english
   * Top 5¬†Space exploration¬†sector companies based on revenues
   * Which companies are trading near their¬†52-week highs\*?\*
   * Which companies have exceeded their analyst EPS estimates for the last three consecutive quarters and a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio below 2?
* Research about any company
   * AMZN
   * What is the fair value of Costco?
   * What are the¬†latest GPU launches¬†by Nvidia?
* Analyze earning calls, latest news, cash flow statement, income statement etc based on your question
   * Summarize Earning call of Nvidia
   * Analyze income statement of amazon with special emphasis on profitability

All of this is completely¬†free, with no sign-ups, no waitlists, and no credit card requirements. Plus, you get to ask unlimited questions without constraints imposed by Chat-GPT, Claude etc.

1ibp20s,NvidiaStock,This is what ChatGPT has to say about today:,"DeepSeek‚Äôs announcement has created a lot of buzz, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily signal a decline in demand for NVIDIA GPUs. In fact, I think the reaction might stem from a misunderstanding of what DeepSeek really achieved and its broader implications. Here‚Äôs why:

Why Demand for NVIDIA GPUs Likely Won‚Äôt Go Down
	1.	Inference Still Requires GPUs:
	‚Ä¢	DeepSeek used test-time scaling, which focuses on enhancing performance during inference, not eliminating the need for GPUs. In fact, test-time scaling can increase inference compute requirements, meaning NVIDIA GPUs could see greater demand as AI models are deployed more widely.
	2.	Training Still Dominates Cutting-Edge AI:
	‚Ä¢	DeepSeek didn‚Äôt create a fundamentally new model from scratch. Instead, they likely optimized an existing base model using reinforcement learning or test-time scaling. This doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for large-scale compute to train foundational models, an area where NVIDIA GPUs are essential.
	3.	AI Adoption Is Growing:
	‚Ä¢	By lowering the cost of creating AI models and open-sourcing their technology, DeepSeek is enabling more players to enter the AI space. This democratization will likely drive demand for GPUs as smaller companies and industries start deploying AI solutions at scale.
	4.	NVIDIA Powers the Infrastructure:
	‚Ä¢	Even if DeepSeek used ‚Äúlower-cost hardware,‚Äù most AI infrastructure still relies on NVIDIA‚Äôs GPUs and software ecosystem (CUDA, TensorRT). As AI adoption grows globally, NVIDIA will remain at the center of the compute stack.

Why the Market Might Be Overreacting
	1.	Misinterpretation of the Announcement:
	‚Ä¢	Investors might perceive DeepSeek‚Äôs cost-efficiency claims as a signal that training costs are falling, threatening NVIDIA‚Äôs dominance in AI hardware. However, this ignores that NVIDIA‚Äôs GPUs are still critical for both training and inference.
	2.	Focus on Short-Term Impact:
	‚Ä¢	The market tends to react quickly to news without fully digesting its implications. While DeepSeek‚Äôs announcement is exciting, it doesn‚Äôt replace the demand for massive pre-training infrastructure, which NVIDIA dominates.
	3.	AI Disruption Takes Time:
	‚Ä¢	Even if DeepSeek‚Äôs methods are disruptive, it will take years for these innovations to scale globally. Meanwhile, NVIDIA‚Äôs GPUs are still the backbone of nearly every major AI effort.

What I Think Will Happen
	‚Ä¢	Short-Term: Markets might overreact as investors worry about a potential disruption to the AI ecosystem. However, this is likely a temporary dip because the fundamentals of NVIDIA‚Äôs business (AI compute demand) remain strong.
	‚Ä¢	Long-Term: DeepSeek‚Äôs cost-efficiency will encourage broader AI adoption, increasing the overall demand for compute. NVIDIA is well-positioned to benefit because of its dominance in AI hardware and software ecosystems.

Key Takeaway

DeepSeek‚Äôs announcement doesn‚Äôt mean NVIDIA‚Äôs GPUs will see less demand‚Äîit‚Äôs more likely to expand AI‚Äôs reach and drive more usage overall.

1iborpj,NvidiaStock,threat to Nvdia/AMD/MU?,"Silicon Valley startup¬†d-Matrix, which is¬†backed by Microsoft, has developed a chiplet-based solution designed for fast, small-batch inference of LLMs in enterprise environments. Its architecture takes an all-digital compute-in-memory approach, using modified SRAM cells for speed and energy efficiency.

The Corsair, d-Matrix‚Äôs current product, is described as the ‚Äúfirst-of-its-kind AI compute platform‚Äù and features two d-Matrix ASICs on a full-height, full-length PCIe card, with four chiplets per ASIC. It achieves a total of 9.6 PFLOPs FP4 compute power with 2GB of SRAM-based performance memory. Unlike traditional designs that rely on expensive HBM, Corsair uses LPDDR5 capacity memory, with up to 256GB per card for handling larger models or batch inference workloads.

d-Matrix says Corsair delivers 10x better interactive performance, 3x energy efficiency and 3x cost-performances compared with GPU alternatives, such as the hugely popular¬†Nvidia¬†H100.

1ibmavz,NvidiaStock,NVDA Fallout: A Missed Opportunity for U.S. Media to Step Up,"

I‚Äôll bet that once the dust settles, we‚Äôll find out one or more of the following is true about DeepSeek:
1.	They lied about how quickly they trained their model or used more advanced chips than they disclosed.
2.	They built their model on top of an open-source LLM like Llama and simply refined it.
3.	They trained the model for far longer than they reported.
4.	They were subsidized by the Chinese government.
5.	They produced an inferior product that‚Äôs overhyped.

Let me be clear: I‚Äôm not going to bash DeepSeek for playing dirty. This is a full-on AI technology war, and we know that both the Chinese government and its companies have never shied away from bending the rules to secure dominance.

What does bother me is the complete lack of scrutiny‚Äînot from our allies in Asia or Europe (they‚Äôve always looked out for their own interests), but from us. When news of DeepSeek‚Äôs ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù hit U.S. shores, not a single American news outlet questioned the validity of their claims. They just parroted the narrative handed to them, no due diligence, no tough questions.

Meanwhile, the market bled. Half a trillion dollars was wiped out, and countless retail investors‚Äîordinary Americans‚Äîlost thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, through their stock portfolios or 401(k)s. All because the media failed to do its job. Only after the damage was done did they start poking holes in DeepSeek‚Äôs FUD story.

I didn‚Äôt lose money on NVDA, as I didn‚Äôt sell. Sure, stock value dropped, but I held because I believe in the company and, more importantly, in American engineering and scientific innovation, and I know I will be made whole. But for so many others, this was a disaster.

I called this an assault on NVDA and the U.S. government (https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1ibc97v/deepseek_assult_on_nvidia_and_us_government/ ) first thing in the morning, before the markets even opened. So did many others on Reddit. Yet, American news outlets stood by, regurgitating propaganda from our adversaries while watching Americans lose their hard-earned savings.

1ibghux,NvidiaStock,DeepSeek - The deep questions,"The main questions for NVDA, TSM, ASML investors is not whether DeepSeek and upcoming AI agents / LLMs are better than Chat GPT, the questions are:

\- Which chips did DeepSeek developper used to train it?

\- If this DeepSeek has been developped using less advanced chips, why hasn't it been developped five years ago using old chips? Why exactly now that on the market were available the faster Nvidia Chips?

If DeepSeek is better than any other AI application, good for them. But to justify the crash of Nvidia, TSM and ASML there must be an evidence that they used old chips to develop it, otherwise, what is happening is an overreaction (I have understood that they needed fewer chips to develop DeepSeek, but the question is: old or advanced chips?

Deepseek claims it did what it did with 6M dollars. As an engineer, I thought about a possible way to accomplish such a thing, and the only way anyone can do this is if they use an existing LLM to train its own LLM. To me, this sounds more like copyright infringement (a problem that these AI companies will have to solve in order to prevent others from training models based on their own models - probably by a government intervention of some sort).

And it seems like this is how they trained it based on the latest news that's coming out - deepseek is confused about its identity and thinks it is chat-gpt. Ah-hah moment for me personally.  The Chinese company didn't ""develop"" any LLM - they just copied / pasted an existing model and made another model.

What does that mean for NVDA? We'll still need a ton of NVDA chips to push the frontier on the AI development. All of this means that it takes much less time to ""catch up"" to  other models, but to be the ""best"" at it, would still require a ton of computing power. And of the 6M dollars, I am pretty sure they forgot to mention all of the smuggled NVDA chips that they were not supposed to have. Seems fishy at best.

Edit: I see some interesting replies. Another thing you guys need to understand is that this AI ""hype"" is literally the only thing that's going to save us from getting screwed. We're in a deep shit here because of government overspending. US government cannot pay the interest on the tax deficit it incurred, and the only easy way to get out of this is to introduce more inflation to make the debt look cheaper. The harder way to get out of this is to be more productive as a nation, and the problem with that is that we can't afford to pay people more and be competitive against countries with much less labor costs. So how does America become ""great"" again? Eliminate the labor cost by replacing everything with AI + industrial automation, and bring manufacturing back to America and automate everything. This AI endeavor isn't just about the replacing software engineers. This is about the survival of this system, and you bet they (the government) will throw all the money they have till this works.

It won't mean the average Joes of America will have a great life. Far from it, a bulk of jobs will be replaced by AI. But it will mean the system will still be ""stable.""

1ibfarm,NvidiaStock,Market Sell Off - Hahaha,"I didn‚Äôt really have any skin in the game per se, until I just scalped shares at $118.

Obviously the AI training algorithm at DeepSeek out performed that of AI from the large US firms (OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, XAi, etc).

1ibc97v,NvidiaStock,DeepSeek assult on NVidia and US Government,"**What‚Äôs the Deal with DeepSeek‚Äôs LLM Claims?**

Here‚Äôs what we know (and what we don‚Äôt) about DeepSeek‚Äôs bold claim that they trained a large language model (LLM) for just $5.58 million. Spoiler: there‚Äôs a lot of questions and not enough answers.

# So, What‚Äôs the Claim?

DeepSeek says they trained an LLM for a fraction of what big names like OpenAI spent on models like ChatGPT. They‚Äôre throwing out that $5.58M number like it‚Äôs fact, but‚Ä¶ how did they actually get to that figure? The only source of this cost info is DeepSeek themselves. No independent audits, no third-party validation‚Äîjust their word. Without transparency, it‚Äôs hard to take this number at face value.

# The Training Setup

According to DeepSeek‚Äôs own tech report, the training took about¬†**2.788 million GPU hours**¬†on¬†**2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs**. Sounds impressive, but here‚Äôs the thing: no one‚Äôs been able to verify that. So, again, we‚Äôre left relying on their claims.

# How Many GPUs Does DeepSeek Actually Have?

This is where it gets a bit murky. Reports about their GPU stockpile are all over the place:

* **Starting Stockpile**: Some say they started with¬†**10,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs**¬†before the U.S. clamped down on exports. (*Source: South China Morning Post*)
* **Current Estimate**: Others think they‚Äôve now got access to¬†**50,000 NVIDIA GPUs**, but no one knows exactly which models (A100, H100, H800). (*Source: Hindustan Times*)
* **H800 GPUs**: DeepSeek claims they used¬†**2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs**¬†for their latest model, DeepSeek-V3. But‚Ä¶ no independent verification there either.

# Why Does It Matter?

Why should we care about the hardware they used? Because their claimed training cost depends directly on the tech they had. If they‚Äôre being vague about the hardware, it makes their $5.58M number even harder to believe.

# Why All the Mystery?

DeepSeek‚Äôs lack of transparency isn‚Äôt just annoying; it‚Äôs shady. Most AI companies go out of their way to show their work and prove their claims. DeepSeek‚Äôs approach? ‚ÄúTrust us, bro.‚Äù That‚Äôs not exactly reassuring. Without details or third-party checks, it‚Äôs easy to assume they‚Äôre hiding something.

# What‚Äôs Their Angle?

Interestingly, DeepSeek‚Äôs LLM is open source. So, if they‚Äôre not making money directly, what‚Äôs in it for them? A couple of possibilities:

1. **Taking on U.S. Policy**¬†The U.S. recently tightened rules on AI chip sales to China, trying to stay on top in the AI race. DeepSeek‚Äôs claims could be a way to challenge those restrictions, showing they can still compete without the U.S. having all the chips (literally).
2. **Pressuring NVIDIA**¬†NVIDIA is the big dog in AI chips, and DeepSeek‚Äôs claims might be aimed at shaking up their dominance. If people think they don‚Äôt need to spend big on NVIDIA‚Äôs hardware to get results, it could push prices down.

# Why the Mixed Reactions?

* **Europe‚Äôs Take**: European markets haven‚Äôt been too critical of DeepSeek. Why? Probably because they‚Äôd love to see the U.S. lose its edge in AI.

Stay tuned.",1737993058.0,Fantastic_Fan61,18,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1ibc97v/deepseek_assult_on_nvidia_and_us_government/,"DeepSeek assult on NVidia and US Government **What‚Äôs the Deal with DeepSeek‚Äôs LLM Claims?**

Here‚Äôs what we know (and what we don‚Äôt) about DeepSeek‚Äôs bold claim that they trained a large language model (LLM) for just $5.58 million. Spoiler: there‚Äôs a lot of questions and not enough answers.

# So, What‚Äôs the Claim?

DeepSeek says they trained an LLM for a fraction of what big names like OpenAI spent on models like ChatGPT. They‚Äôre throwing out that $5.58M number like it‚Äôs fact, but‚Ä¶ how did they actually get to that figure? The only source of this cost info is DeepSeek themselves. No independent audits, no third-party validation‚Äîjust their word. Without transparency, it‚Äôs hard to take this number at face value.

# The Training Setup

According to DeepSeek‚Äôs own tech report, the training took about¬†**2.788 million GPU hours**¬†on¬†**2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs**. Sounds impressive, but here‚Äôs the thing: no one‚Äôs been able to verify that. So, again, we‚Äôre left relying on their claims.

# How Many GPUs Does DeepSeek Actually Have?

This is where it gets a bit murky. Reports about their GPU stockpile are all over the place:

* **Starting Stockpile**: Some say they started with¬†**10,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs**¬†before the U.S. clamped down on exports. (*Source: South China Morning Post*)
* **Current Estimate**: Others think they‚Äôve now got access to¬†**50,000 NVIDIA GPUs**, but no one knows exactly which models (A100, H100, H800). (*Source: Hindustan Times*)
* **H800 GPUs**: DeepSeek claims they used¬†**2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs**¬†for their latest model, DeepSeek-V3. But‚Ä¶ no independent verification there either.

# Why Does It Matter?

Why should we care about the hardware they used? Because their claimed training cost depends directly on the tech they had. If they‚Äôre being vague about the hardware, it makes their $5.58M number even harder to believe.

# Why All the Mystery?

DeepSeek‚Äôs lack of transparency isn‚Äôt just annoying; it‚Äôs shady. Most AI companies go out of their way to show their work and prove their claims. DeepSeek‚Äôs approach? ‚ÄúTrust us, bro.‚Äù That‚Äôs not exactly reassuring. Without details or third-party checks, it‚Äôs easy to assume they‚Äôre hiding something.

# What‚Äôs Their Angle?

Interestingly, DeepSeek‚Äôs LLM is open source. So, if they‚Äôre not making money directly, what‚Äôs in it for them? A couple of possibilities:

1. **Taking on U.S. Policy**¬†The U.S. recently tightened rules on AI chip sales to China, trying to stay on top in the AI race. DeepSeek‚Äôs claims could be a way to challenge those restrictions, showing they can still compete without the U.S. having all the chips (literally).
2. **Pressuring NVIDIA**¬†NVIDIA is the big dog in AI chips, and DeepSeek‚Äôs claims might be aimed at shaking up their dominance. If people think they don‚Äôt need to spend big on NVIDIA‚Äôs hardware to get results, it could push prices down.

# Why the Mixed Reactions?

* **Europe‚Äôs Take**: European markets haven‚Äôt been too critical of DeepSeek. Why? Probably because they‚Äôd love to see the U.S. lose its edge in AI.
* **U.S. Financial Institutions**: Meanwhile, U.S. financial news outlets and financial institutions are all over it. But let‚Äôs be real: they don‚Äôt actually care who wins the AI race. They just want market volatility to make a quick buck.

# TL;DR

1ib4ean,NvidiaStock,LET ME CUT THROUGH THE DEEPSEEK FUD AND GIVE YOU THE REALITY AS I SEE IT. (I've done a ton of research on this and feel well informed in my opinion here),"Firstly, I will say that the LLM Deepseek has produced is extremely impressive, and IS a significant competitor to the products produced at OpenAI and at META, and Open source at that.

However, some of the claims being made out of China on Deepseek are highly unrealistic.¬†

Firstly, the fact that they claim their model cost only $6M to produce.¬†

This has raised significant eyebrows on Wallstreet and is basically why the mag7 names are all down today. After all, the MAg7 names have spent hundreds of billions in CAPEX towards their AI efforts. Now we are saying that a small Chinese company has produced the leading LLM for just $6M. It would appear then that the Mag7 companies including Microsoft and Meta have been highly inefficient.¬†

Of course, this is naturally a major hyperbole. $6M is literally laughable in the face of the hundreds of billions spent at OpenAI to develop ChatGPT. I mean yes, I admit that the MAG7 firms have been somewhat inefficient in their spending. Zuckerberg and Sundar both have admitted to the fact that they have overspent on AI, but to the extent that $6M is all they needed, is totally ridiculous.¬†

Understand this, a few weeks ago, Mark Zuckerberg was on Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast. He literally discussed Deepseek there. He admitted that it was ‚ÄòA very advanced model‚Äô, and presumably he knew about the supposed cost efficiency of DeepSeek. Fast forward 2 weeks, and META increases CAPEX by over a third to power AI ambitions. Do you think Zuckerberg is stupid? He must be, to try out a much cheaper Chinese model, see the benefits of it, and instead of being worried that he‚Äôs overspent on CAPEX, he instead increases CAPEX further. Something there doesn‚Äôt add up right? And we are talking about one of the brightest brains in tech. Clearly he either knows that that $6M is total bullshit, or his CAPEX goals are towards something much much more than just an LLM like what Deepseek has built (I will come onto this point).¬†

Now let‚Äôs consider this from another angle. Supposedly, the CCP knows that they have, in Deepseek, a world leading LLM which cost just $6M. They would then realise the fact that AI can be done much more cheaply than the hundreds of billions of dollars that the US are throwing at it. Why the hell, then, would they announce a 1 trillion yen ($137B) funding plan to support their AI needs. I mean, surely that would be totally wasteful. $6M for the deepseek built. $137B funding plan. Makes no sense right, when you think about it?

Let‚Äôs then go onto the other claim that Deepseek makes that seems highly unlikely. This is the fact that they claim they did not have access to any of the high power NVDA chips. These are the very expensive Chips that the US companies have all built their AI models on. If true, it would be highly impressive that Deepseek has managed this without needing these leading chips, which may point to the fact that these Leading NVDA chips are actually pretty redundant. Again, it would point to the fact that these American firms have massively overspent on their AI needs.¬†

And secondly, it would point to the fact that US export controls haven‚Äôt done much to hold China back, because they are still innovating better than US firms, even WITHOUT the high power H100 Nvidia Chips.¬†

Firstly, it would seem highly unlikely that they have managed this build with the much older Nvidia chips. Scale AI CEO made comments over the weekend that it is common knowledge that Deepseek actually DO have high power Nvidia H100 chips. And they have a shit ton of them. 50,000 is the claim that he made. This may be overstated potentially, but what‚Äôs clear is that they likely DO have H100 chips. They just cannot admit to having them due to the fact that they are supposed to be subject to GPU export controls. 50,000 H100s would put them at the scale of Tesla btw, and would make that $6M figure totally impossible.¬†

Frankly, the fact that they would have these H100 chips seems highly likely. Deepseek is owned by a partner company which is a Quant firm, which was documented buying H100 chips before the export ban came in, so it would make sense that they have access to these high power chips that they are claiming not to.¬†

Why would they be lying then?¬†

Well, 2 very good reasons:

1) to convince American policymakers that GPU export controls have been ineffective at impeding Chinese AI

2) to entice foreign investors & international attention, which will in turn accelerate the development of Chinese AI

And by the way, the Chinese have a very long history of exaggerating their claims on Technology. You can look up any of the following as an example of this:

* ¬†""Brain-reading"" AI
* ¬†The ""three-second battery""
* ¬†Quantum satellite ""Micius""
* ¬†Faster-than-light communications
* ¬†Hongxin Semiconductor (HSMC)
* ¬†Jiaolong Submersible
* Tokamak Reactor

So the fact that China would lie about this is nothing new at all.¬†

Even if we were to take Deepseek totally at face value. So they have produced a highly efficient LLM at very low Capex. FINE. Do you think these Mag7 firms‚Äô end goal is LLMs? No way at all. The end goal is AGI guys. That‚Äôs what their CAPEx spending is going towards. That‚Äôs what the billions of dollars being spent and all the AI infrastructure is for. That‚Äôs what the race is towards. And even with LLMs, there is a LONG way to go to get to AGI. And AGIs WILL require a lot of heavy computing chips. And Deepseek claims they don‚Äôt have them. Even if they do have them, they and China will likely need many many more to reach AGI. And the US can restrict these chips more stringently to handicap China in their push towards what is the final end goal, AGI.¬†

So even if true, Deepseek would be highly impressive, yes, but does not mean that the MAg7 firms have wasted their CAPEX and have been beaten. Not at all, as the race is still very much ongoing towards the end goal. Commoditzation of LLMs is already known by everyone to be inevitable. That‚Äôs why META has gone open source already on their Llama. This is not what the mag7 firms want. They want fully fledged AGI.¬†

Okay now let‚Äôs look at some of the bear claims here for individual companies.¬†

Firstly, Meta. Many are making the argument that Deepseek has proven itself to be more effective than Llama, and so Llama becomes redundant. Not really, that‚Äôs not how I see it at all. I see Deepseek as a massive validation for META that they are on the right tracks with their Llama project, and their ambition for creating n open source LLM. Deepseek has shown the value of this, as developers can come in and upgrade the code basically. More and more people will see the benefit in this open source, and will want it. And META are the guys who are delivering that in the US.¬†

As META Chief AI scientist said over the weekend, ‚Äúdeepseek has profited from open research and open source/ They came up with new ideas and built on top of other people‚Äôs work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit form it. That‚Äôs the power of open source. Deepseek is a victory for open source‚Äù.¬†

That last line is the tell. Deepseek is a victory for open source. What is META‚Äôs Llama. Open source. Do the maths, it‚Äôs a victory for META in reality.¬†

The bigger FUD, however, is for NVIDIA.¬†Some are calling this the Nvidia killer.

Let‚Äôs look at the bear‚Äôs claims. They claim that wow, Deepseek produced their LLM without even needing Nvidia chips. It means that Nvidia H100 and Blackwell chips are NOT necessary, which will lead to much lower demand. Furthermore, they argue that these US AI firms have MASSIVELY overspent on CAPEX, and will be beaten out by MUCH MUCH more efficient firms like Deepseek. This will eventually lead them out of business, which will flood the second hand market with Nvidia chips, which will reduce the price and appeal of the chips.¬†

The other argument is that if AI can be done SO much more efficiently, then it will by definition of being more efficient, require LESS chips to power it than previously thought. As such, Nvidia demand may have been massively overstated to date.¬†

Let‚Äôs look at this first point then. Well, if we add in the most likely fact of the matter, that Deepseek DID have Nvidia H100 chips, and a ton of them at that, then it defuncts the argument that you can produce this kind of AI model WIHTOUT needing Nvidia chips. The reality is, that you DO need Nvidia chips. And even Deepseek needed these Nvidia chips. So there is no real issue for the future demand of Nvidia chips.¬†

Seocndly, the fact that these US AI firms will go out of business. Well, No. Why would they? As I mentioned, they are working towards AGI. Suggesting they have been outdone by Deepseek is to suggest their end goal was LLMs. I have already argued to you that this was NOT their end goal.¬†

Then the last point, That less Chips will be needed if Ai can be done more efficnelty.¬†

Well, No. Even if we suggest that AI CAN be done more efficiently than first thought, if we consider Jevon‚Äôs Paradox, we realise that this would STILL mean that we will use MORE AI chips rather than less.¬†

Consider it with the following examples.¬†

Think about batteries. One may think that as batteries became more efficient, fewer batteries would be needed to power our electronics. But that‚Äôs not what happened. As batteries became more efficient, more and more electricals started using Batteries. And the demand for batteries went up.¬†

Think about farming equipment for instance. One may argue that as more efficient farming technology came about, perhaps less would be needed. Well, not really. As it got more efficient, it led to more and more farming, which increased the demand for farming equipment.

This idea is Jevon‚Äôs paradox. The idea that as something gets more effcient, the demand for it actually increases.¬†

And we can see that with AI. If AI becomes more efficient, and more cost effective then, it becomes more accessible to the masses. Which will increase the roll out of AI, which will, on aggregate, increase the demand for AI infrastructure such as chips.¬†

So Nvidia chips will NOT lose out from this. It will actually WIN from this.¬†

As such, I do not buy into the idea that Deepseek is any fundamental risk to Nvidia or META or the other Mag7 firms. We can see some weak initial price action as many will buy into the FUD that‚Äôs being spread online. But the reality is that the long term future of these companies is largely unaffected by Deepseek. Firstly, Deepseek has massively exaggerated their claims. Secondly, the fact that Deepseek has produced this efficient LLM, does not compromise the MAg7 end goal, and actually should Increase Nvidia demand by Jevon‚Äôs paradox.¬†",1737970135.0,TearRepresentative56,538,132,https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1ib4ean/let_me_cut_through_the_deepseek_fud_and_give_you/,"LET ME CUT THROUGH THE DEEPSEEK FUD AND GIVE YOU THE REALITY AS I SEE IT. (I've done a ton of research on this and feel well informed in my opinion here) Firstly, I will say that the LLM Deepseek has produced is extremely impressive, and IS a significant competitor to the products produced at OpenAI and at META, and Open source at that.

However, some of the claims being made out of China on Deepseek are highly unrealistic.¬†

Firstly, the fact that they claim their model cost only $6M to produce.¬†

This has raised significant eyebrows on Wallstreet and is basically why the mag7 names are all down today. After all, the MAg7 names have spent hundreds of billions in CAPEX towards their AI efforts. Now we are saying that a small Chinese company has produced the leading LLM for just $6M. It would appear then that the Mag7 companies including Microsoft and Meta have been highly inefficient.¬†

Of course, this is naturally a major hyperbole. $6M is literally laughable in the face of the hundreds of billions spent at OpenAI to develop ChatGPT. I mean yes, I admit that the MAG7 firms have been somewhat inefficient in their spending. Zuckerberg and Sundar both have admitted to the fact that they have overspent on AI, but to the extent that $6M is all they needed, is totally ridiculous.¬†

Understand this, a few weeks ago, Mark Zuckerberg was on Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast. He literally discussed Deepseek there. He admitted that it was ‚ÄòA very advanced model‚Äô, and presumably he knew about the supposed cost efficiency of DeepSeek. Fast forward 2 weeks, and META increases CAPEX by over a third to power AI ambitions. Do you think Zuckerberg is stupid? He must be, to try out a much cheaper Chinese model, see the benefits of it, and instead of being worried that he‚Äôs overspent on CAPEX, he instead increases CAPEX further. Something there doesn‚Äôt add up right? And we are talking about one of the brightest brains in tech. Clearly he either knows that that $6M is total bullshit, or his CAPEX goals are towards something much much more than just an LLM like what Deepseek has built (I will come onto this point).¬†

Now let‚Äôs consider this from another angle. Supposedly, the CCP knows that they have, in Deepseek, a world leading LLM which cost just $6M. They would then realise the fact that AI can be done much more cheaply than the hundreds of billions of dollars that the US are throwing at it. Why the hell, then, would they announce a 1 trillion yen ($137B) funding plan to support their AI needs. I mean, surely that would be totally wasteful. $6M for the deepseek built. $137B funding plan. Makes no sense right, when you think about it?

Let‚Äôs then go onto the other claim that Deepseek makes that seems highly unlikely. This is the fact that they claim they did not have access to any of the high power NVDA chips. These are the very expensive Chips that the US companies have all built their AI models on. If true, it would be highly impressive that Deepseek has managed this without needing these leading chips, which may point to the fact that these Leading NVDA chips are actually pretty redundant. Again, it would point to the fact that these American firms have massively overspent on their AI needs.¬†

And secondly, it would point to the fact that US export controls haven‚Äôt done much to hold China back, because they are still innovating better than US firms, even WITHOUT the high power H100 Nvidia Chips.¬†

Firstly, it would seem highly unlikely that they have managed this build with the much older Nvidia chips. Scale AI CEO made comments over the weekend that it is common knowledge that Deepseek actually DO have high power Nvidia H100 chips. And they have a shit ton of them. 50,000 is the claim that he made. This may be overstated potentially, but what‚Äôs clear is that they likely DO have H100 chips. They just cannot admit to having them due to the fact that they are supposed to be subject to GPU export controls. 50,000 H100s would put them at the scale of Tesla btw, and would make that $6M figure totally impossible.¬†

Frankly, the fact that they would have these H100 chips seems highly likely. Deepseek is owned by a partner company which is a Quant firm, which was documented buying H100 chips before the export ban came in, so it would make sense that they have access to these high power chips that they are claiming not to.¬†

Why would they be lying then?¬†

Well, 2 very good reasons:

1) to convince American policymakers that GPU export controls have been ineffective at impeding Chinese AI

2) to entice foreign investors & international attention, which will in turn accelerate the development of Chinese AI

And by the way, the Chinese have a very long history of exaggerating their claims on Technology. You can look up any of the following as an example of this:

* ¬†""Brain-reading"" AI
* ¬†The ""three-second battery""
* ¬†Quantum satellite ""Micius""
* ¬†Faster-than-light communications
* ¬†Hongxin Semiconductor (HSMC)
* ¬†Jiaolong Submersible
* Tokamak Reactor

So the fact that China would lie about this is nothing new at all.¬†

Even if we were to take Deepseek totally at face value. So they have produced a highly efficient LLM at very low Capex. FINE. Do you think these Mag7 firms‚Äô end goal is LLMs? No way at all. The end goal is AGI guys. That‚Äôs what their CAPEx spending is going towards. That‚Äôs what the billions of dollars being spent and all the AI infrastructure is for. That‚Äôs what the race is towards. And even with LLMs, there is a LONG way to go to get to AGI. And AGIs WILL require a lot of heavy computing chips. And Deepseek claims they don‚Äôt have them. Even if they do have them, they and China will likely need many many more to reach AGI. And the US can restrict these chips more stringently to handicap China in their push towards what is the final end goal, AGI.¬†

So even if true, Deepseek would be highly impressive, yes, but does not mean that the MAg7 firms have wasted their CAPEX and have been beaten. Not at all, as the race is still very much ongoing towards the end goal. Commoditzation of LLMs is already known by everyone to be inevitable.

For week the bears have been out trying to make everyone sell since January 1st!  That's what happens EVERY year!  It's all manipulated to transfer the poor peoples money to the rich!  This is how it is folks!

So, I bought a bunch of NVDA at $130 a few weeks ago and I'm NEVER selling it cause I KNOW that in 5 years it'll be above $200 or $300 a share!  My predictions have ALWAYS come true!

A few years ago I was laughed at and mocked for buying NVDA at $140 a share PREsplit when even Jim Cramer was calling ""Nvidia is a loser!"" on cnbc!  Look it up on youtube....  ""nvda a loser cramer"" and watch towards end of the video when he says ... ""and NVidia is a loser and I'm SHORT the stock""  LOL that's when I was scooping up loads of it and I STILL haven't sold my original basis!

Then they have on Steve Weiss and all the bear crew who are always depressed and telling people ""things are gonna get bad and I'm selling!""  ... lol every time they say that a couple months later they're ""regrettably buying in higher""!  ..... and I've seen it countless times on cnbc, over and over!  I watch cnbS .... religiously too .... just for laughs!

Go NVDA!!  Back to $140 and higher is my guess!  Glad I just scooped up more at $130!  And if it falls again (MANIPULATION again!) .... I'll load up more like clockwork!

  
..... AND don't get me wrong I'm not a gambler although I do trade around the edges with small amounts.  I am mostly in the QQQM etf.  I don't think anybody knows which mag7 will do best long term and life's too short to try and figure it out,  To me QQQ will still outperform VOO or VTI for the next 20 years....  unless all of a sudden everyone is gonna give up their phones and we're going back to horse and buggy and oil lamps!

Then they have on Steve Weiss and all the bear crew who are always depressed and telling people ""things are gonna get bad and I'm selling!""  ... lol every time they say that a couple months later they're ""regrettably buying in higher""!  ..... and I've seen it countless times on cnbc, over and over!  I watch cnbS .... religiously too .... just for laughs!

Go NVDA!!  Back to $140 and higher is my guess!  Glad I just scooped up more at $130!  And if it falls again (MANIPULATION again!) .... I'll load up more like clockwork!

  
..... AND don't get me wrong I'm not a gambler although I do trade around the edges with small amounts.  I am mostly in the QQQM etf.  I don't think anybody knows which mag7 will do best long term and life's too short to try and figure it out,  To me QQQ will still outperform VOO or VTI for the next 20 years....  unless all of a sudden everyone is gonna give up their phones and we're going back to horse and buggy and oil lamps!

Thanks Team!"
1i6p3kh,NvidiaStock,Big boost $NVDA,"11:48 AM EST, 01/21/2025 (MT Newswires) -- Nvidia (NVDA) will likely post strong Q4 results and Q1 guidance as recent investor worries about a ""near term 'air-pocket' are overblown,"" UBS said in a note to clients emailed Tuesday.

Nvidia has ""essentially tread water since last earnings"" amid supply chain concerns and worries surrounding the ramp of Blackwell server racks, the investment firm said.

However, ""Blackwell chipset/compute board yields have inflected higher, and mix in both FQ4 (Jan) and FQ1 (Apr) is shifting very rapidly to Blackwell and away from Hopper,"" said UBS analysts including Timothy Arcuri.

Also, Nvidia ""recognizes revenue when ODMs/OEMs take title of compute boards and we believe that in many cases end customers like the big hyperscalers are using a buy and sell model to leverage ODMs or their suppliers' working capital, and in some instances may be providing bridge financing for this inventory,"" the note said.

In addition, the main hardware issue has ""seen significant recent improvement,"" UBS said, adding, however, more improvement on other components is still needed.

The investment firm's estimate for Nvidia's Q4 revenue is ""largely unchanged"" at about $42.1 billion, while the Q1 revenue estimate was also kept at roughly $47 billion, the note said.

Been obsessively tracking Pelosi's NVDA moves since mid-2023 and today's filing is peak Nancy. In her latest disclosure ahead of inauguration, she pulled off three separate NVDA transactions:

1. Exercised 500 calls from November (50,000 shares @ $12 strike)
2. Sold 10,000 of those shares for massive profits
3. Immediately bought more NVDA stock with some of the gains

The timing is insane - those November calls were bought right before NVDA's latest run. She's basically:

* Locking in profits from the huge run-up
* Maintaining a massive NVDA position
* Using house money to increase her stake

I started copying her NVDA trades last year and I'm up 43%. She's playing NVDA like a fiddle - taking profits while maintaining her position before inauguration.

This follows her usual pattern - she's been building and rolling NVDA positions since I started watching. While everyone debates the ethics, I just quietly copy the trades lol.

And before anyone mentions the filing delay - most people won't even hear about these moves for days or weeks. By the time CNBC covers it, we're already positioned. Still plenty of gains to be made if you're paying attention, but that's on you to decide. NFA of course.

The additions maintain each post's distinct voice while making the same point about filing delays and market opportunity. First one is more matter-of-fact, second is more casual/conspiratorial in tone.

   * As a deep learning engineer, I knew NVIDIA dominated the GPU market, but I had zero experience in due diligence (DD).

   * It was a ""take the risk and see"" moment‚Äîcompletely unplanned.
* **My Trading Setup:**
   * I had two trading apps: one for short-term investments and another for long-term holdings.
   * I used an iPhone 6s back then and never checked the long-term app regularly.

1hzcrdy,NvidiaStock,NVDA May Actually Be a Value Stock,"To me a ""value"" stock isn't one that has a low P/E but a stock whose revenue & earnings **justify** the the P/E. A stock can be very high P/E and still be a value buy if its earnings and growth justify it.

By overlaying NVDA estimated earnings along with the contracts, we can see a discrepancy between what the option market predicts and what the valuation model predicts.

Here the P/E is reduced from the TTM P/E of 60x to 48x to give some margin of safety. We can see that the price bounces off of the 48x earnings line fairly reliably the last few years. 

By plotting the contracts at their strikes and filtering for > 0.5 deltas, we can also see what the options market is thinking.

Strangely... NVDA is simultaneously a meme stock yet also a value stock according to this model...
