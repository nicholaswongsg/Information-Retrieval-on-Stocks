""You will also be eligible for an annual bonus, ranging from zero to a maximum of 20% of your bonus eligible salary during the rewards period based on your performance.

1izt046,microsoft,Cheapest way to get Word & Excel after Microsoft 365’s Price Hike?,"I’ve always preferred Microsoft Word and Excel for my hobbies, they’re straightforward, offline, and don’t force me to work in a browser window.

I don’t really need PowerPoint, OneNote, or Outlook; just the basics.

I know some folks recommend Google Docs and Sheets, but I don’t want to rely solely on a web app. I’ve also heard about WPS Office as a potential replacement, which apparently has a free tier and decent compatibility with Word and Excel files. Has anyone tried it, and does it really stand up to what Microsoft offers for simple tasks and spreadsheets? Or are there other tricks to buy Office cheaply, like a perpetual license or a one-off purchase for just Word and Excel? I’d love to hear your suggestions before I jump into another subscription.

1izrdz6,microsoft,Post-interview questions: how long to wait after loop interviews/sending thank-you notes,"I had my four-person loop interview for an Azure CXP role last Thursday and Friday.  I had a few questions that I wasn't able to find recent answers on in the sub or elsewhere:

1) Now that the interviews are over, how long should I wait before asking the recruiter if there's any feedback or followup?  I didn't get any followup from the recruiter or scheduler after I'd gotten scheduled, and the loop interview participants each said they'd be putting in their feedback over the following few days.  

Some posts in the sub mentioned anywhere from three days to three weeks, so if I'm in for the long haul, no worries, I'd like to at least know what to expect.

2) The manager in the first loop interview mentioned that I could always reach out if I had any questions or other info to add.  My only contact emails are for the recruiter and scheduler.  Would it be inappropriate if I tried sending a thank-you email to the manager by guessing their email address?  

I already emailing them with firstnamelastname@microsoft, firstname.lastname, and firstinitiallastname, but got access denied bounces each time.  I'm guessing this is intended behavior on MS' side to stop people like me from spamming would-be hiring managers.  I got the vibe from the manager that they were fine with hearing from me again but if that's just a polite mention rather than an offer to stay in touch, I can back off, but if it's a good idea to go so far as to message them on Linkedin, so be it.

1ivswn9,microsoft,My email address is dead to Microsoft due to failed Authenticator migration,"I had been a reasonably happy user of Microsoft services for many years. I had Microsoft 365 and Visual Studio subscriptions. Some time ago something convinced me to add two-factor authentication to my login and that meant installing Microsoft Authenticator on my Google Pixel 6 phone. A few months ago, I replaced my phone with a brand new Google Pixel 9. As far as I know, I installed Authenticator on my new phone and everything was fine. Then I wiped my old phone and sent it in for recycling. 

A little bit later I found that Authenticator no longer did any authenticating. When I tried logging in via my PC, it said to watch for Authenticator to display a code but the code never came. I tried resetting my password and probably a few other things but I always ended up in a doom loop where it asked for a code that I could not supply.

After searching online for help, I finally ended up in Microsoft support chat. I spent a few hours chatting with a representative but eventually it became clear that somehow my authentication credentials had not transferred properly from my old phone to my new phone. I was so naive to think that this just meant that I had to authenticate myself the hard way, by giving answers to secret questions, or sending in my picture id, or perhaps even showing up in person at some facility. Imagine my dismay when I was told that there is no backup authentication process. It is the end of the line for my email address at Microsoft. Perhaps if I faked my own death and got a court order to release the account to my wife, then they might help me. Other than that, I am screwed.

There might be others also but let’s focus on these.

I started using Copilot more frequently and really like how integrated it is with Teams, Outlook and Sharepoint. Teams transcriptions with AI generated meeting notes is awesome.

However, I am trying to find a good place to store all notes and tasks but I am so confused.

Microsoft always seems to release products which competes with already existing services. They are not overlapping 100% but they do it enough to confuse users.

Just to give you some examples, we have Planner and ToDo, Loop and OneNote… and now Copilot Pages.
There might be others also but let’s focus on these.

I started using Copilot more frequently and really like how integrated it is with Teams, Outlook and Sharepoint. Teams transcriptions with AI generated meeting notes is awesome.

However, I am trying to find a good place to store all notes and tasks but I am so confused.

I have updated our DKIM which Google suggested could have been causing the issue, though I don't actually have any insight into why. The issue started several weeks ago, while I was overseas, so it's not IP related.

One client asked her tech team to look into it and they found all our emails quarantined and were able to release them. But I don't think this will remedy the issue going forward (new emails will still get blocked) and won't help with any potential new customers, who we won't know whether or not they're receiving our mails as we won't know if they're on MS365.

\*\*EDITED TO ADD\*\* Another client's IT team has confirmed my mail was blocked for Malware. I've scanned both my laptop and my website and haven't found any sign of malware anywhere.

Is there \*any\* way to contact Microsoft / MS365 as a non-user? Or any other way to lodge an appeal against this false positive for our domain?

I've found various help centre listings but they all assume I'm a MS customer. I would be super grateful for any help or advice you could offer."
1is6620,microsoft,"Why is Microsoft stuff considered bad and bloated, but Google, Apple, and many other stuff is not?","Why is Microsoft stuff considered bad and bloated, but Google, Apple, and many other stuff is not?

Honestly, I've had this question for a very long while now. Everywhere I go, I always see excessive hate on Microsoft products and software, with people trying to debloat Windows, and while as a tech enthusiast I see the appeal of it, it simply doesn't do much to affect system performance, IMHO. Things like Edge, OneDrive, and other apps from Windows and the Microsoft ecosystem are considered bad, but when it comes to things from Google and Apple, they seem to be praised more, and people don't hate them as much. People actually want them on their system and don't try to remove them. 
When it comes to third-party software from other companies, it gets worse. They will praise them like there is no other. I'm sure they're not much better than the other offerings; they serve the same purpose anyways. 
I get everything with it being expensive or having subscriptions or not being customizable, but I'm curious on everybody's reasoning for hating Microsoft products, if you do at all, as I never understood why people do. 
As someone that has jumped between ecosystems, and eventually settled with a hybrid Google ecosystem, I want to understand the hate for other software. 
I personally don't hate Microsoft apps, they just don't work well for me.

tl;dr: Why the hate for Microsoft products when similar stuff from Google/Apple/others gets praise?

Looking to get a new customer access solution for a rather large user base. The team is looking at option and I wanted to ask a couple questions about how Entra performs in space.

Do we need to get the Suite for it to be as good as Okta? Or is P1 or P2 good enough?

I want to adjust the threat policy for the people within my organization. I have purchased one premium license, and the options ""Safe Attachments"" and ""Safe Links"" are immediately available.

Now, when a user (Business Standard) tries to open a URL from, for example, Teams, you can see that the link is being checked. In other words, this feature also appears to be active for users with a different license than premium.

So, do these premium options work tenant-wide, regardless of the licenses assigned to other users? Is this expected behavior, or would it still be advisable to upgrade all users to premium?

Since few days ago i found out with my Phone that i could interact with copilot by speaking. (copilot free version chat, by web Chrome on Android)

In these days was all ok but today, while speaking with copilot free basic version by mobile Chrome in my Samsung Phone, I Heard a Music in background while copilot Was speaking with me.

HoW is possible free version of the vocal chat of copilot can play music?

COPILOT vocal chat free version cannot reproduce music. Why today I heard a music in background and a strange little breath and a short laugh as well in the background and While COPILOT was speaking with me?

these noises and music where heard for few seconda in the background meanwhile copilot was speaking with me so it was like some sounds in background...

Anyone ever experienced something like this?

Maybe is Just an impression? Sometimes copilot make odd laughs, Maybe its still part of Ai? Or there was someone that was there to listening? Its strange free version of copilot could reproduce music and for few seconds and it stops.. Copilot not play sounds

I joined Microsoft as an L63 Sr SDE in September in the C+E org. So far things have ben stressful, microsoft doesn't really have an onboarding bootcamp, so I feel like I am kind of expected to ramp up very fast and deliver on my sprint tasks.

I feelI am doing okay. I was also a full stack developer role, but I got reorged into a data engineering role. For example, I was building typescript/react based apps and maintaining backends also in same language. My new team mostly runs jobs on Azure Data FActory, and uses Scala, and Spark, big mindset shift for me. The tasks are coming top down, and i find myself working on weekeends as the estimates are assigned by the manager.

The Nov connect was really looking forward, and was more of a mock connect if you will. My real connect will be in May/June I think, what are the odds that they give me a LITE or 80% in the first connect?

I don't have a lot of faith in my manager, as she has a poker face. I am aslo struggling because my team  and manager included have a very strong accent that I cannot understand even after watching the recorded videos.

I completed a screening(first) round for IC2 Software Engineer at Microsoft with Hiring Manager. My primary experience is with enterprise software development with Java, but the role is more inclined with Low level programming. 



So tasked with a couple of coding tasks in C. First one is simple, and I did it pretty quick. But the second one, When I'm implementing the brute force approach by having three loops. The interview mentioned It's better to do it in an optimized way by using a data structure.



I could not think of this because I was coding with C (When asked about it, I rated myself a 7 in C programming) in the interview when my primary language is Java. Also, my recruiter mentioned me that there would be no coding, it will focus primarily on my resume. So, I prepared only my experience and some concepts. This was also a reason for me not doing well.



The interview is scheduled for 45 mins, but it lasted for 30 mins. The interview mentioned the role would be comprising extremely low-level programming.

1ij5pj4,microsoft,Updated Privacy Policy should be illegal,"**TLDR:  If you opt out of Microsoft's new connected services you can't sync with OneDrive but if you opt in to connected services, Microsoft will scrape all of your content for AI use.**

So - I saw a few posts online recently about the updated privacy policy and this new ""connected services"" malarkey.  And of course I went down a rabbit hole - that I wish I hadn't.  

Here's the gist of it.  If you have all of the 3 connected services options selected   
  
1) Turn on experiences that analyze your content   
2) Turn on experiences that download online content   
3) Turn on all connected experiences.  
  
\- you have zero privacy, and Microsoft WILL use AI to scrape your content.  Even though they say they don't - who are we actually kidding?  The lay language in the privacy policy says certain features like **Microsoft 365 Copilot** do access and process your data to provide ***""assistance""***. Copilot connects large language models to your organizational data, including documents, emails, and meetings, to generate contextually relevant responses. (uh-huh).  This processing is done to ***assist*** you and is not used to train Microsoft's AI models.  

You can choose to disconnect them but here's what will happen if you do.  For example, I want to ensure that my OneNote syncs across my devices.  If I opt out of #3 above (turn on all connected experiences) this is what Microsoft says will happen:

*Cloud-based features like* ***OneNote syncing, real-time collaboration in Word/Excel, and automatic saving to OneDrive*** *will* ***not work****.*

Microsoft explicitly states that disabling these services means you lose access to any feature that requires cloud connectivity, including:

* ***OneNote cloud sync*** *(your notes will only be stored locally)*
* ***Auto-save & real-time collaboration*** *in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint*
* ***Online templates, stock images, and AI-powered tools*** *like Editor or Designer*

*If you want* ***OneNote to sync across devices****, you must enable at least some level of connected services. You can still use* ***OneNote locally*** *without syncing if you keep cloud features disabled.*

  
Now - you would think that ok - I'll just use option #2 because it allows you to sync OneNote with the cloud while keeping things as private as possible. But no - you can't just select option #2.  If you want to select either #1 or #2, you MUST opt in to #3 - turning on ALL connected experiences.  

So, If your **main goal is privacy**, you'd have to disable everything and manually back up.  

HOW HAS MICROSOFT BEEN ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH THIS???  How is this legal?  WTAF is going on???

HOW HAS MICROSOFT BEEN ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH THIS???  How is this legal?  WTAF is going on???

1iiaywe,microsoft,Microsoft Product Design Internship Interview,"

Hi! 

So, I applied to Microsoft’s PD Internship in November. Yesterday, I received a follow-up email that I’ve been invited to the final round of interviews! 

The email said I have a 45-minute portfolio presentation and 3 1:1 interviews. Less than week from in now- has anyone gone through the interview process for this internship before? I just had a couple of questions. 

- in the 45 minutes for your presentation, is any of that time left for the interviewers to ask questions? I have 2 slide decks on 2 projects, presenting them takes 30 min. Should that be enough?
- does anyone remember the behavioral questions they ask on 1:1
- If I were lucky enough to receive an offer (unlikely, LOL), would they let me choose a start date? I’ve commited to another summer internship at a FAANG and would hate to renege. Was hoping I could take this for fall.

1ig0qgu,microsoft,Senior Technical Specialist vs Cloud Solutions Architect,"Hi everyone,

Hoping to get some clarity on the differences between the roles, and what potential career paths would be after doing either for a few years.

I’m about to take a role as a Specialist for Azure after being a TAM at AWS, and would like to know a bit more from the folks that have been doing it for a while, what it’s like. 

At AWS there are Solutions architects, but they don’t have the specialist role. I know the specialist role is more sales oriented, and I’m excited about that as I do want to get into sales more. But, I don’t quite understand the differences between it and the CSA, since to me, they’re both sales? 

Any information would be appreciated! Thanks!

[Post | Feed | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7288556194070200321/)

  
Having interviewed for a SWE role and worked for other big non-tech companies. I would say the interview is deeply flawed at Microsoft. I've never seen a place that is more focused on algorithm and design pattern knowledge. Solving LeetCode problems, You can be passionate about the work, hard-working, eager to learn and growth, have a breath of knowledge, creative, able to collaborate and work with others but if you can't code a link list in C# (which is something rarely done or used) then no hire. I would like to see the SWE in Test roles brought back but it may be too late. "

The last thing I had deleted was about post Malone saying he made an Oreo flavor, and I said ""I don't want post Malone's white cream"" which of course doesn't contain any bad words. Anyways, MSN seems to have an insanely strict comment filter that makes it impossible to say almost anything unless it's positive towards the article and not negative towards anything."

1i7z7wu,microsoft,Cheaper hidden Office offer without Copilot,"I am (was, actually) a Microsoft 365 Family subscriber. A few days ago Copilot started showing up integrated into my Office apps. I am not a big fan of Microsoft shoving and trying to upsell Copilot everywhere, but I have grown accostumed to it and I thought no more of the subject. However, a few days after that, when browsing through my Microsoft account settings, I accidentally discovered that for the ""privilege"" of having Copilot unwillingly shoved into my face, my subscription is now 30% (!!!) more expensive. Fortunately I was on an annual subscription and thus rebilling was still a few months away!

After pondering for a while, I decided to eradicate the problem at the source and canceled my subscription. I discovered, and want to share with potential users facing the same dilemma, that when you are canceling your subscription, you are presented with a hidden, 30% cheaper M365 subscription without Copilot. That offer is not accessible anywhere outside the cancelation screen. 

 This ""hidden offer when canceling"" seems right out of the playbook of unreputable adult content merchants rather than reputable software vendors. It was a bit too shady for me and so I've moved on to a non-Microsoft office product, but for those interested in getting the non-Copilot version of Office at the previous price, take note of the existence of this hidden offer.  

 In my opinion, Microsoft COULD have been user friendly when selling these features to users. For example: 

* ""We have integrated Copilot into Office. Do you want to try it out? Click here to activate a 15-day trial. If you like it, you can enable the Copilot add-on for your subscription for a 30% price increase. You can also disable this add-on in the future at any time and it will take effect at the next time your subscription renews."" 
* New subscribers of M365 can choose to subscribe with or without the Copilot add-on. 

What  Microsoft actually chose to do: 

* Everyone gets a silent 30% price increase. Users do not get notified of the price increase. There is no explanation of the reason behind the price increase (Copilot integration). 
* Copilot gets forcefully shoved in everyone's face inside Office. (The OneNote integration is specially disgusting, the Copilot icon literally follows your cursor around everywhere.) There is no way to disable it except for using a global setting for ""connected experiences"" - which disables a lot more than just Copilot. 
* They implemented a hidden offer without Copilot integration and the associated price increase that is kept secret and only presented to users when canceling their subscription as a last resort customer retention tactic - because they KNEW perfectly well that some subscribers would cancel after such a gigantic price increase. ",1737622459.0,forger-eight,28,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/1i7z7wu/cheaper_hidden_office_offer_without_copilot/,"Cheaper hidden Office offer without Copilot I am (was, actually) a Microsoft 365 Family subscriber.

1i62c6z,microsoft,"It’s 2025, and Microsoft’s Clipboard Still Feels Like a 90s Afterthought.","# It’s 2025, and Microsoft’s Clipboard Still Feels Like a 90s Afterthought.

It’s ***comically absurd*** that in **2025**, Microsoft still treats the Clipboard as an optional extra rather than an essential, foundational tool for modern workflows. Windows 11's clipboard utility feels like a half-baked effort: buried behind shortcuts (***Win + V***\*)\*, missing meaningful customization options, and generally lacking the functionality you’d expect from a company of Microsoft’s so-called caliber.

# (A) Why the Clipboard is So Ridiculous

# 1. It’s Not User-Friendly

Okay, wow - **Win + V** enables clipboard history! But wait...why isn’t there an intuitive way to pin this tool to the **taskbar** or **system tray**? For such an essential, foundational feature, it’s **shockingly underpromoted and hidden**. Most users probably have ***no idea*** it even exists.

# 2. Zero Customization Options

* Clipboard history maxes out at **25 entries**. Why? That limit is laughably arbitrary when even free third-party tools like Ditto (*a lightweight, free app that I spent 3 hours setting up today due to ARM-processor compatibility issues; see further below*) let you store **thousands**.
* There are no **search**, **grouping**, or **organization features** to manage your clipboard history.
* Cross-device syncing? LMAO - forget it, unless you’re fully invested in the Microsoft ecosystem—another missed opportunity.

# 3. Buried Behind a Shortcut

**Win + V** is fine for keyboard-centric users, but what about those who navigate primarily with a **mouse**? **LIKE MOST OF US.** *Why not make it accessible through a taskbar icon or system tray dropdown*?! Hiding such an integral feature behind a shortcut makes no sense in 2025.

# 4. Minimal Integration

Why doesn’t Clipboard history appear in **context menus** or integrate directly with other apps? A simple **“Paste from History”** option when right-clicking would be such an obvious addition—but alas, it’s nowhere to be found.

# (B) What Windows Should Have By Now

# 1. An Intuitive GUI

A **taskbar-integrated clipboard manager** that opens with a single click, like **Ditto** or **macOS’s Spotlight**, should be standard by now.

# 2. Better History Management

* **Grouping, pinning, and tagging** clipboard entries for frequent reuse would save time and reduce frustration.
* A customizable limit on history size (because 25 entries is a slap in the face to power users).

# 3. Cross-Device Sync That Works

While Windows offers **Clipboard Sync** through a Microsoft Account, it’s so buried and clunky that most users don’t even bother. Why isn’t this a seamless default feature, like Apple’s **Universal Clipboard**?

# 4. A ""Clipboard Dashboard""

Imagine pressing **Win + V** and seeing a full-fledged clipboard dashboard where you could:

* **Search** for specific items.
* **Drag-and-drop** entries directly into apps.
* **Edit** clipboard items on the spot.

This would elevate the Clipboard from an afterthought to a productivity tool that meets the needs of modern users.

# (C) The ARM Struggle Makes It Worse

If that weren’t bad enough, the experience is even worse on an **ARM-based device**, like my supposedly ""top-of-the-line"" **MS Surface Laptop 7th Edition** (**Snapdragon X** ***Elite*** **Processor, 64 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, 15""**). Despite ARM processors being around for years, the lack of **native support** for many popular apps and utilities—including robust clipboard managers like Ditto—turns basic tasks into 3+ hour-long frustrating *odysseys*.

I spent over **three hours** today figuring out how to get Ditto working on my ARM device, thanks to developers and Microsoft seemingly forgetting that ARM users exist. Emulation often leads to **performance issues** or outright incompatibility, leaving users like me at the mercy of trial and error. Navigating Windows 11’s already weak clipboard utility on ARM feels like salt in the wound.

Microsoft’s failure to optimize its software for ARM architecture only amplifies the absurdity of fighting the operating system for **basic functionality**.

# Clipboard Management Isn’t Just for ""Power Users""

Clipboard management isn’t some niche, advanced feature—it’s foundational. Whether you’re copying a **password**, a **link**, or a **block of text**, everyone uses it daily. It baffles that Microsoft hasn’t prioritized making this feature **accessible**, **powerful**, and **intuitive** in Windows 11.

Until they do, third-party tools will continue filling the void Microsoft’s short-sightedness left.

1i12dcs,microsoft,Microsoft streaming technology ,"Hello, I wonder if anyone in this group remember a couple of old tech demos that Microsoft showed off, many years ago? I would like to refresh my memory on what the technology was called.
[I thought that it was called ""Sailfish"" or something similar, but when I search for it, there is only an operative system that shows up...]

It was a streaming technology that allowed you to display pictures over a slow dial up connection.

In one demo, you saw what looked like a bunch of different colored squares, but then they zoomed in and you could see that they where many high resolution pictures. I think they did something similar with a text (declaration of independence?).

I believe they worked on the technology for a couple of years and in a later demo, they showed off something similar to Google Street View. Where they had a 360 view of a famous location and they streamed in pictures taken by tourists from that location. As you moved around the pictures came into view. And they used the metadata to show dem in the right location, in the right direction (and angle?).

1hworcs,microsoft,OneDrive requires you to have free space to copy to another user's OneDrive ,"Appears if your personal OneDrive is full, you cannot upload non-OneDrive files to someone else’s OneDrive who has plenty of free space. Microsoft wants to sell space on both ends even though one end is not used in the copy at all. I had to clear out my OneDrive before the copy could be done.

I have never had a use for OneDrive. If it was just a backup, I would be fine with it. However, removing my local files and storing only in the cloud is not want I want. I avoided it for years by not even signing into a MS account with my builds.

Since we implemented it at work, I decided to enable it last year on my new gaming laptop at home. It promptly hit the space limit and the messages started about buying more space. Only way to stop that, without buying space I do not need, was to disable it. Then MS keeps turning it back on and does not even remember settings (desktop sync turned off). I had to create a local copy of all files in OneDrive (so much for saving space) and tell all my applications to not save to Documents folder anymore.

I have been in IT for nearly 40 years. I owe much of my career to MS products. However, I really wish MS would sell an OS again. What they sell now is a platform to sell us more stuff and it is getting annoying. I don’t need OneDrive stealing my files. It is not a “backup”. I don’t need “news” clickbait that never gets you to the real story. I do not need your app store. I don’t even need your web browser. Sell me a base OS and let me chose what to install, and DON’T re-enable stuff I turn off with updates. If my games played reliably on Linux I would switch in heartbeat.

1hta93a,microsoft,LIQUIDTEXT WOES ON SURFACE PRO 11- SEEKING ALTERNATIVE,"Hello everyone!

I’ve been a loyal user of LiquidText for my legal work, as it’s been a game-changer for managing case notes and documents. About six months ago, I decided to upgrade to a Surface Pro 11, excited about its ARM chip and overall utility for my profession. Unfortunately, that excitement quickly turned to frustration when I discovered the LiquidText app doesn’t work properly on the ARM chip.

Since then, I’ve been in *constant* communication with the LiquidText team, trying to get the issue resolved. Six months later, all I have to show for my patience are lagging performance, frequent app crashes, and a series of unhelpful responses from their support team.

Here’s the kicker: instead of solving the problem, the LiquidText team has essentially told me to *buy a new laptop*. Below are excerpts from their responses for your amusement:

""Hi,   We had been working on it. I am afraid the issue is with the ARM chip, this chip has been having issues with LiquidText for some time. Would you try any other device that runs with X64? I apologize for all the inconvenience.    Best wishes,"" ""We are working with the Microsoft team, and it seems like this specific surface model is having the same issues with LiquidText, a few other users have reported the issue as well. Microsoft is a bit slow at resolving issues, so the progress might come a bit late. I advise you to use any other laptop if you have any to see if the app is running better without any lags and crashes. ""

Essentially, their solution to their app's failure is for *me* to shell out more money for new hardware. That’s like a tailor telling you to change your body because the suit doesn’t fit. Can anyone recommend apps similar to LiquidText that actually work seamlessly on the Surface Pro 11 with an ARM chip? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences because it seems like I need to jump ship.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions. And LiquidText, if you're reading this: maybe take a break from blaming Microsoft and focus on fixing your app.",1735980114.0,srajonsingh,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/1hta93a/liquidtext_woes_on_surface_pro_11_seeking/,"LIQUIDTEXT WOES ON SURFACE PRO 11- SEEKING ALTERNATIVE Hello everyone!

Microsoft is a bit slow at resolving issues, so the progress might come a bit late. I advise you to use any other laptop if you have any to see if the app is running better without any lags and crashes. ""

Essentially, their solution to their app's failure is for *me* to shell out more money for new hardware. That’s like a tailor telling you to change your body because the suit doesn’t fit. Can anyone recommend apps similar to LiquidText that actually work seamlessly on the Surface Pro 11 with an ARM chip? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences because it seems like I need to jump ship.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions. And LiquidText, if you're reading this: maybe take a break from blaming Microsoft and focus on fixing your app."

1hpayf7,microsoft,Seeking advice on getting a technical program mgr role at MSFT,"Hello, I'm looking for a new job. I'm seeking advice on applying and landing a job at Microsoft as a Technical Program Manager. The two questions I have:

\- what to highlight on the resume to get the attention of the people reviewing resumes (e.g., the person that screens the resume, hiring manager) to get that call for an interview?  What I've done is reviewed a few MSFT TPM postings, reviewed my work experience, and did my best to align my work experience to what MSFT is seeking in the posting.  E.g., highlighting leading cross-functional teams, how to respond to challenges, and other things).

\- interview prep - any recommendations on how to prepare for an interview of a TPM at MSFT? I will browse  reddit and glassdoor to see what people are saying. While I feel my communication is great, I tend to get a bit nervous in interviews so I want to practice to gain more confidence. 

my background: I'm currently working as an IT Project Manager (and have been an Technical/IT Project manager on Infrastructure, Data analytics, and Security projects for the last seven years - also, I've spent some time leading programs). Prior to being an Project Manager, I was a Group Leader, System Engineer, and C# Developer. I've worked most of my career in software / technology companies. I've spoken with two TPMs at different technology companies to learn about the role and background people come from - I feel my prior experience makes me a great fit as a TPM (I just need to sell it! :) )

I want to start my job search on MSFT because I've always admired the company for its innovations and respect in the industry. I will apply to other companies, but my dream job would be MSFT and I figure the prep work I need to do for MSFT will serve me well for opportunities at other companies.

What I've done is reviewed a few MSFT TPM postings, reviewed my work experience, and did my best to align my work experience to what MSFT is seeking in the posting.  E.g., highlighting leading cross-functional teams, how to respond to challenges, and other things).

\- interview prep - any recommendations on how to prepare for an interview of a TPM at MSFT? I will browse  reddit and glassdoor to see what people are saying. While I feel my communication is great, I tend to get a bit nervous in interviews so I want to practice to gain more confidence. 

my background: I'm currently working as an IT Project Manager (and have been an Technical/IT Project manager on Infrastructure, Data analytics, and Security projects for the last seven years - also, I've spent some time leading programs). Prior to being an Project Manager, I was a Group Leader, System Engineer, and C# Developer. I've worked most of my career in software / technology companies. I've spoken with two TPMs at different technology companies to learn about the role and background people come from - I feel my prior experience makes me a great fit as a TPM (I just need to sell it! :) )

I want to start my job search on MSFT because I've always admired the company for its innovations and respect in the industry. I will apply to other companies, but my dream job would be MSFT and I figure the prep work I need to do for MSFT will serve me well for opportunities at other companies.

Thank you everyone!

Windows installer? I have had to install Windows 11 24H2 five times, and every time I do, that white background washes everything out. Can you please add a dark mode to the Windows installer? The white background is so bright it's irritating and almost impossible to see.

I think the installation process is challenging for a lot of other visually impaired people. 

  
Can you add a detailed install status to see what installing the Windows installer is so bare it's just a progress percentage and some fun graphics? Make it fun again!

 Can you make it so we can customize the installation of Windows, allowing us to add our drivers and software so they install automatically via USB?

Windows installer? I have had to install Windows 11 24H2 five times, and every time I do, that white background washes everything out. Can you please add a dark mode to the Windows installer? The white background is so bright it's irritating and almost impossible to see.

  
I am also legally blind, and I am about 2 inches away from the screen when computing, so it is even harder to see to install Windows, and the white background washes everything out. 

I think the installation process is challenging for a lot of other visually impaired people. 

  
Can you add a detailed install status to see what installing the Windows installer is so bare it's just a progress percentage and some fun graphics? Make it fun again!

 Can you make it so we can customize the installation of Windows, allowing us to add our drivers and software so they install automatically via USB?

  
Finally, please allow us to add our product key to the Microsoft account so that when we log in, it automatically asks which key to install.

  
Thank you for reading this.

1hhoku3,microsoft,Microsoft is getting worse,"Hello,

I have a feeling that in the last few years the product quality strongly decreased. 

I've got so many update errors since Windows 11. All the time inplace upgrades to fix it. New Windows 11 24h2 breaks my whole dolby surround system, which I only fixed by downgrade to 23h2. 

Visual studio is buggy and I've bugs all the time which lead to other problems. Debugger stopping to work. Live changes don't apply. Can't input texts in editor. Generating duplicates files, which breaks the whole production. I need to build my software and don't have time to handle bugs of visual studio!? 

Outlook is slow as hell. The new interface is really bad. Office is also buggy. 

Edge browser has also lots of bugs. Like copying pasting passwords pastes two times. Strange thing: Chrome works properly, although same engine?

Some other games that came with it were Purble Place, a Pong-like game with powerups and an electricity theme, and a scenic game about origami boats on a lake where you control them to solve puzzles by tapping the water near them to make them move. 

Gameplay consisted of picking a music track, selecting a difficulty from Easy, Normal, or Hard, and then tapping on brightly colored music sparks when they reached the center of the speakers at the right time.

Easy - Three speakers, and the sparks move from the top of the screen to the bottom.

Normal - Three? Four? or Five? (I do not remember as it has been a very long time.) speakers, and the sparks move from the top of the screen to the bottom.

Hard - Four speakers in a layout much like the ""4"" dots on a die. Sparks move from all sorts of different directions towards their respectively colored speakers and their paths overlap in order to confuse the player.

Are there any levers I can pull to negotiate - pto/base/rsu etc?  And how stable is this role?

So talked to recruiter and he said he put ""max"" for rsu and sign on because he saw my yoe.

1h6yzvj,microsoft,This idea has been stuck with me for years.,"Windows 11 Mobile: A Bold Opportunity for Microsoft to Revolutionize Mobile Computing

Post:
Since the release of the Snapdragon Elite chipsets in notebooks and now their integration into Android devices, I see a very rare and great opportunity for Microsoft’s next evolution. I truly believe Microsoft can take on Android and iOS with a strategic shift toward making Windows 11 a viable option for mobile devices.

Imagine this:

Native Mobile Calling and Network Support: Windows 11 on phones, enhanced with built-in features for calling, texting, and full SIM card network integration. This would require the development of native drivers for modems and SIM cards, but it’s absolutely feasible given the architecture of Snapdragon chips.

A Mobile-Optimized Theme/Launcher: Windows 11 is already touch-friendly, but adapting the interface with a dedicated launcher or theme specifically designed for smaller screens would make it seamless for mobile use.

Microsoft Store for Mobile Apps: A dedicated section in the Microsoft Store for mobile-focused apps optimized for Windows 11 on phones. This could include mobile versions of existing apps, as well as unique offerings like a native dialer, messaging tools, and enhanced battery management apps.


With Snapdragon Elite chips capable of running full-fledged Windows applications, Microsoft could offer users the best of both worlds: a PC in their pocket with the functionality of a smartphone. This would attract power users who want productivity on the go and create a new ecosystem to rival Android and iOS.

Why Now?

Microsoft has the chance to bridge the gap between laptops and mobile devices in a way that Apple and Google haven’t fully achieved. With developers already familiar with the Windows ecosystem, transitioning to mobile app development wouldn’t be as daunting as starting from scratch.

What Needs to Happen

1. Microsoft should develop core mobile drivers and APIs to support calling, texting, and data on Snapdragon-enabled Windows devices.


2. A mobile-focused UI overlay or launcher should be released to improve usability.


3. Partnerships with developers to populate a mobile-dedicated app section in the Microsoft Store.


4. Aggressive marketing to highlight the benefits of a unified Windows ecosystem.



The Opportunity

This isn’t just about making Windows 11 work on phones—it’s about rethinking what a mobile device can be. A Windows-powered phone could seamlessly switch between PC and mobile modes, with full access to both productivity tools and mobile-centric apps.

What do you think? Could Microsoft take on Android and iOS with this approach? Let’s discuss how feasible this vision is and what features we’d like to see in a Windows 11 mobile future.

Post:
Since the release of the Snapdragon Elite chipsets in notebooks and now their integration into Android devices, I see a very rare and great opportunity for Microsoft’s next evolution. I truly believe Microsoft can take on Android and iOS with a strategic shift toward making Windows 11 a viable option for mobile devices.

Imagine this:

Native Mobile Calling and Network Support: Windows 11 on phones, enhanced with built-in features for calling, texting, and full SIM card network integration. This would require the development of native drivers for modems and SIM cards, but it’s absolutely feasible given the architecture of Snapdragon chips.

A Mobile-Optimized Theme/Launcher: Windows 11 is already touch-friendly, but adapting the interface with a dedicated launcher or theme specifically designed for smaller screens would make it seamless for mobile use. Think of a highly customizable, tile-based UI with gesture support to cater to mobile users.

You only need to carry your phone and a light screen. 

Samsung already has this called DeX. 

This is now coming rapidly now that the mobile chipsets are fast enough for this. 

Look up snapdragon elite. 
Look up Apples M processors which will probably soon be integrated in mobile phones. 

I guess we should see this within 2-4 years. 

Apple will solve it with IPhone + some hybrid

Google/Samsung with Android OS.

1h13b73,microsoft,About Microsoft Family and glitches,"I'm 16 years old, with Microsoft Family on my phone, which tracks my screentime and sends it to my Mom- and it's currently my exam time, for second term.   
It's glitched out, alot these past months I've used it. As in- some days screen time usage is missing when the report comes each week, and sometimes, it shows that I have screen time for apps that I haven't even used. But this incident really takes the cake for me.   
  
I was focused on the coming exams, and I still am studying right now... But I remembered that I had taken a break for a few half an hour, after coming back from the exam I had written today, and after that, I'd studied about 4-5 hours of study with breaks for lunch, snack and reading a few other books in the middle.. So, I decide to check my screen time, because I wanted a break.  
And just seconds before I'm writing this, at 6 o' clock- the app showed a whooping *18 hours of usage.* On a game app that *I didn't even touch today.*  
  
I had only touched my phone, for about half an hour, or one hour max- but this happens. And it's not like I used it before at all- I woke up at six in the morning today, touched up and revised what had to be revised, then I went to the exam at 8, came back at 12 during noon, and the rest of the time was utilized for studies and for the next exam..

When I zoom into a white board I created which was last saved on my previous device (Surface Pro 7), it just lags in a way I have never seen this thing lag. No, seriously, this is the only time it has lagged frl. It worked normally some time before that even on my Surface Pro 7 until one day when all of that wasn't true anymore. One thing worth noting is that I have tried deleting those notes before, but they just re-appeared. I am not sure if I recall that happening in reality, but that might be the culprit? Though I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling after that too, and that never worked either... Anyway,

**I want to ask fellow Microsoft White Board users the following:**

1.  What solutions work to make zooming in and out normal for once.
2. Why the white board runs off the internet when transcription of notes instead of the flipping hardware. 
3. Let me know if question 2 has any validity to it.
4.  How can I make it clearly known to Microsoft that this issue has to be fixed.
5. Lastly, does Microsoft really care anymore?

**Note:** I'm asking all of this because it has been about a year since I revisited the White Board as of today, and to get as much coverage, I will post this here and to the White Board Subreddit if there is one, because I'm admittedly too lazy to do the research myself as I am too occupied to do so with one week away from finals, and me trying to catch up with any unfinished or missing work.

1gyh3a9,microsoft,SQL Questions,"Hi I am not familiar with SQL but someone I spoke with seemed to think it would be a good solution for an issue I have and I was hoping you guys could tell me whether it would be worth pursuing as a solution for my company.

I am trying to improve the projections that we use for a transportation platform. The issue with this platform and all others in the industry is that they don’t account do a large portion of the amount of time we actually spend on trips so I am trying to find a workable solution to improve our projections in concert with the platform we use.

I have actually built out the solution in excel but tbh it’s cumbersome, glitchy, and overwhelms my computer. In order to make the solution I need to pull data from the following 3 sources on the web-based platform.

1. Pull live data of the status of trips from the dispatch screen.

2. Pull the driver shift information on a daily basis (and likely update it periodically throughout the day when necessary).

3. Download a file from our platform, with historical data for projections, on a daily basis and uploaded into SQL likely from and excel or csv file.

In addition, there is a fourth thing I’d like to do but is not required.

4. I’d like to push out our projections to our clients so they have a resource to know when we have availability for transports throughout the day as our availability changes.

Is this doable using SQL? Is there a better solution out there? What resources would you recommend to learn SQL?

1gygu8p,microsoft,“Our Outlook team will have an answer and be back in touch with you within two hours”,"So said a well spoken and oh so polite tech agent on the phone. Why? I had had no access to my two GMail accounts on my Outlook client for nigh on ten days. I have spent (no exaggeration) six work days on the simple issue of moving my professional and personal computing needs from an aging desktop to a new laptop. No luck on email. Lots of details but to spare you, dear readers, a very cursory outline. 

Adding the GMail accounts to Outlook was required because of my 365 account from my employer and that email account. I have had GMail accounts forwarded to Outlook for probably 20 years - flawlessly. I simply changed my password on Google two weeks ago after having been advised of a security breach. Everything came crashing down. 

I’ve had calls to tech support at my employer where they quickly fixed the email connectivity to my iPhone; to hours long calls with Dell computer, that did nothing other than loose me one of the two accounts and had no idea of what the problem was, to Google that does not do phone support but directs you back into endless AI loops with solutions that don’t work, to a local tech professional who spent two days repeatedly changing server settings and saying after each  iteration, “I have no idea why;” to four calls with Microsoft to people who took screen control, got one account working on my desktop (which was not part of the original issue but became one), and then finally surrendered saying they could not resolve the question. So infuriatingly both a tech yesterday and a supervisor were on the phone (“because we spent so long on this”) and assured me of the call back after various teams read the “copiously written file.”  Unless he was writing War and Peace on those many silences on the phone, there is no copious file. 

Between, having watched this clown show, I learned what the steps were to creating app PW’s in Google (very counterintuitively hidden away) and how to configure Outlook to add files (which I have done for 20 years anyway) and was successful in repairing the files on the desktop (which is going to disappear once the laptop is configured). But the laptop is another issue. I got one account to work today and at the test step, things signed on and sent the outgoing message to my Outlook mail - ON MY PHONE and DESKTOP, but not the laptop. 

So short of just using two web mail locations to retrieve messages that I cannot port from account to account and I don’t even want to go into the hash which is now my calendar, it seems that these haughty and mighty corporations cannot manage their own products. 

But I can tell you from memory the Port addresses both in and outgoing for GMail. Want to know the security protocol too?  I got it. 

A big shame on Google, Microsoft, and Dell, and gratitude to the young woman at the office who got things fixed on my phone.

I'm a 15-year-old student, with 2 years of software engineering (working on both personal projects and one for clients). Now, my school is doing work experience for Year 10s (I'm in Year 10) in June - so I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to join the company on the work experience week.

I'm not sure if Microsoft allows 15-year-olds to join the company for work experience. So guys, if you work at Microsoft UK, would you be able to help me out?

For those of you who are wondering, I am very good with Javascript (including JS frameworks like Nextjs) and UI design.

1gwjs8t,microsoft,Why is Microsoft trying so hard to force Bing on users at any price?,"Microsoft Edge is my daily driver, it's a really robust browser, has very useful features and very good performance and RAM usage. However, the thing that's keeping most people from using it is the fact that Microsoft makes a lot of pressure to use their search engine, Bing. It wouldn't be a problem if it was a gentle, dismissible advert, but the practices how the company to make you use it are so invasive that they can keep people away from the browser. Here's just a selection of them:

* Full screen pop-ups when I turn on my PC tell me to ""Restore the recommended browser settings""
* Microsoft PC Manager shows the same reminder like an antivirus alert
* On Windows 10, a button with the same saying is located at the very top of the Settings app
* The settings for the default search engine are hidden deep at the bottom of the privacy settings
* Right today, the default search engine reset from Google to Bing without asking me

What's the purpose of this method? People who aren't using Edge won't hear about Bing anyway, and people who want to give Edge a try will immediately set Google as default search engine and eventually be annoyed by Microsoft trying to prevent you to do so. Bing's interface is just too overwhelming compared to Google's minimalist one.

1gw6rcq,microsoft,Passkeys or Authenticator Login into Windows 11?,"Hello!

I've been drinking the passwordless Kool Aid recently and like the idea of logging into Windows via Passkeys or at the very least, Microsoft Authenticator.

Is it even possible to do this for Windows 11 when logging in under my Microsoft 365 Family account?

My desktop does not have a camera or a finger print reader, so Windows Hello seemingly forces me to have a PIN, which does not seem very secure.

1gsl8mz,microsoft,Microsoft Authenticator vs 1Password: A Comparative Discussion on Secret Management,"Hello, Reddit community!

I’ve been reflecting on the tools we use to manage and secure our secrets—everything from passwords to sensitive data. With the increasing complexity of digital life, having a reliable and comprehensive solution for managing and storing secrets is critical. I wanted to compare two tools I’ve used extensively: **Microsoft Authenticator** and **1Password**.

Here’s my take:

**Core Features Both Tools Offer**

Both Microsoft Authenticator and 1Password share some basic functionalities:

1. **Password Management**: Both tools securely store and manage credentials.
2. **MFA Token Support**: Each supports TOTP-based codes, adding a layer of security for multi-factor authentication.
3. **Cross-Mobile Platform Support**: They work on iOS and Android, and sync data across devices.
4. **Secure Storage**: Data stored in both apps is encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.
5. **Sync Across Devices**: Both enable seamless synchronization for access from anywhere. 

**Why 1Password Stands Out**

1Password takes secret management to a whole new level by supporting **a wider range of secret types**, including:

* **Passwords and MFA Tokens**: Just like Microsoft Authenticator.
* **Certificates and Keys**: Securely store SSL/TLS certificates and SSH keys.
* **API Secrets**: Manage API keys and application credentials safely.
* **Personal Data**: Store credit card information, private notes, ID numbers, and more.

Additionally, 1Password excels at **autofill**. It’s not just about filling usernames and passwords:

* Automatically fills username and password (First Factor Authentication) and TOTP codes or Passkeys (Second Factor Authentication).
* Completes logins with one click, even submitting login forms on your behalf.
* Fully supports autofill across browsers, desktop, and mobile app.

1Password also offers cross desktop and mobile platform supports including web browser extensions and controlled sharing of secrets with teams or family members. It’s a one-stop solution for managing every type of sensitive data.

**Where Microsoft Authenticator Shines**

Microsoft Authenticator focuses on solely **identity verification** and works seamlessly with the Microsoft ecosystem. Key features include:

* **Push Notifications for MFA**: Approve logins with a tap, sometimes requiring number matching for added security.
* **Passwordless Authentication**: Works great with Azure AD and Microsoft accounts.
* **Offline MFA Support**: Generate TOTP codes without an internet connection.

However, it’s **limited to managing passwords and MFA tokens** and relies heavily on mobile devices for interaction.

**The User Experience Gap**

One of the biggest differences is the **user experience**:

* With 1Password, you don’t need to pick up your phone every time. Its browser extensions and desktop apps make secret management effortless.
* Microsoft Authenticator, while excellent for MFA, often requires users to unlock their phones and manually approve prompts—this can get cumbersome, especially during frequent logins. 

**Suggestions for Microsoft Authenticator**

To match the versatility of 1Password, Microsoft Authenticator could:

* Expand support for different secret types (e.g., API keys, certificates, personal data).
* Improve autofill capabilities for passwords and MFA codes.
* Offer better cross-platform and browser extension support for users who prefer desktop workflows. 

**Conclusion**

Both tools are great for specific purposes. If you’re deeply tied to the Microsoft ecosystem and primarily need MFA, Microsoft Authenticator is a solid choice. However, if you need a **comprehensive solution for managing all types of secrets**, 1Password stands out as the superior tool. It not only enhances security but also simplifies workflows with its user-friendly features.

What are your thoughts? Have you used both tools? I’d love to hear how you manage your secrets and whether there are other tools you prefer.",1731755934.0,shaffiqvin,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/1gsl8mz/microsoft_authenticator_vs_1password_a/,"Microsoft Authenticator vs 1Password: A Comparative Discussion on Secret Management Hello, Reddit community!

1grvdld,microsoft,Emails going to spam with Outlook ,"Hello everyone,

I am very new to this world so any help would be massively appreciated.

I recently set up my own company and created a website / company email using NameCheap. Since my first ever email I have had an issue with all my emails going to spam with Outook / Hotmail. With Gmail I have no issue whatsoever and I have done multiple tests online which state my IP address is in good health and Mail tester is giving me 10/10 score.

The reason this is so important to me is because having just launched my own company, I need to be able to reach out to old clients / connections which is mostly done via email. I don't want to worry if my email made it to their inbox and if they have viewed it or not. At my previous company we sent out many new business emails on a daily basis and they all entered the inbox with no issues, which is something I didn't account for before starting my own company.

I purchased the domain and hosting servers (shared server) from NameCheap (maybe this is the issue, I don't know), I have set all the backend up correctly and spent hours on the live chat with them essentially trying everything to get my emails into the inbox. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Records are all set up correctly. It is a new domain (20 days old), from the research I have conducted it suggests I need time to warm up the email and build a good reputation for the domain  before it enters the inbox.

I then spoke with Microsoft live chat for another few hours and they was very helpful considering I am not a customer of there's but they also was unable to fix the problem. After continuous checks, Microsoft came to the decision it was due to the spam filters and there was nothing they could do their end.  So I was just wondering if this is common?

Has anyone else experienced this issue and what did you do?

Is this normal for every new domain to enter the spam folder?

Should I bite the bullet and consider changing to a Microsoft / Gmail account? Obviously considerably more expensive but will this help the issue? Is it an easy process? Will I benefit from spending the extra £?

Again from my research conducted so far, I don't believe there is a short cut in getting out of spam but what sort of time scale am I looking at? Does anyone have any tips for speeding this process up?

I could reach out to my network and ask people if I could email them and for them to whitelist me, which is what was suggested from NameCheap but how many people would I need to do this? Are there any tips for this?

Should I give in and get my own dedicated IP Address? From the tests I conducted online it states the IP address is not the issue and may not change the results?

Any tools I should be using? Free if possible as budget is tight.

Why is it only Outlook / Hotmail that are affected? Do they have a stricter spam filter?

Once I am out of the spam will I have to be very careful not to go back into it?

1gpz3n5,microsoft,Surface laptop 7 thoughts and feedback,"So I got my surface laptop 7 a week ago now and honestly I’ve got mixed feelings about it.

Firstly I love the way it got improved this year and the team really nailed on with this on, I love the rounded corners, the fast processor and amazing battery life, and by far for me the most exciting part about this year’s model is the haptic trackpad from Sensel.

Now I ran into just 3 inconveniences and one feature I’d like to see.

1. There’s no way to know if the battery is dead or if the laptop is on, what I mean is that there’s no light anywhere to indicate that the battery is drained or even like a battery empty icon displaying on the screen like on a macbook.

2. The facial recognition camera seems to take a pretty long time to turn on when the laptop starts up or when having to use windows hello to authenticate, this can probably be fixed through a software update.

3. The haptic trackpad sometimes looses it’s haptics and it’s glitchy sometimes, you also have to lift your finger and reapply 2 fingers for a right click instead of being able to leave 1 finger on the trackpad and adding the second finger for right click, it doesn’t recognize that and will assume it still has 1 finger on the trackpad since it never left the trackpad.

This is probably some bug in windows or a driver bug, but i’m sure it’s able to be fixed with an update.

1gpsi7m,microsoft,Does Microsoft really value candidate’s potential? (Interview Experience),"Yesterday, after a long process, I found out I wouldn’t be moving forward for the SWE internship at Microsoft. 

Honestly, I’m not that mad or disappointed—just feeling a bit off about the experience. I’d put in a lot of time preparing and doing my best, but the process was exhausting, and the approach felt, at times, disrespectful.

To start, my recruiter reached out with an email at 2 AM my time asking about availability. I replied first thing in the morning, but then I received a call at 1 AM the following day—after I’d clarified that I was in EST. Small things like that reflect a lack of consideration, and they add up.

The interviews themselves were intense, especially for an intern-level role. As a second-year student just getting into DSA, I didn’t expect a hard LeetCode problem that essentially required having seen the trick behind it beforehand to solve it in only 30 minutes. Despite not solving it fully, I stayed engaged—asked clarifying questions, walked through a test case, and explained my approach step-by-step. Apparently, that wasn’t enough.

The second problem went better, and I felt good about my efficient solution. When asked about space complexity, I clarified it was linear, only to be prompted by the interviewer with, “You mean O(1)?” No, I didn’t. These moments leave you questioning how the process is evaluated.

In my final interview, feedback claimed I was “stuck” on explaining a sorting algorithm. Yet I’d clearly explained bubble sort and its downsides, so this feedback felt unexpected. I wrapped up by asking thoughtful questions about what worked well with previous interns. Surprisingly, the interviewer said, “I don’t know; I haven’t worked with the intern team yet.” It was a disappointing lack of insight.

I’m proud of how I communicated, asked questions, and stayed focused throughout the process. That was also what the recruiter underlined when I received the feedback, and that is why I am not disappointed because I know my communication skills were above the baseline. But this experience left me wondering if the interview culture here truly values a candidate’s potential or if it’s more about memorizing coding questions than recognizing soft skills and growth potential.

To anyone preparing for big tech interviews: make sure you’re LeetCode-ready, even if you believe your soft skills and adaptability count. 

In the end, I’m taking this as a learning experience, and I’m grateful for what it taught me. I just wish the process could’ve been more about collaboration and respect.

(Interview Experience) Yesterday, after a long process, I found out I wouldn’t be moving forward for the SWE internship at Microsoft. 

Honestly, I’m not that mad or disappointed—just feeling a bit off about the experience. I’d put in a lot of time preparing and doing my best, but the process was exhausting, and the approach felt, at times, disrespectful.

To start, my recruiter reached out with an email at 2 AM my time asking about availability. I replied first thing in the morning, but then I received a call at 1 AM the following day—after I’d clarified that I was in EST. Small things like that reflect a lack of consideration, and they add up.

The interviews themselves were intense, especially for an intern-level role. As a second-year student just getting into DSA, I didn’t expect a hard LeetCode problem that essentially required having seen the trick behind it beforehand to solve it in only 30 minutes. Despite not solving it fully, I stayed engaged—asked clarifying questions, walked through a test case, and explained my approach step-by-step. Apparently, that wasn’t enough.

The second problem went better, and I felt good about my efficient solution. When asked about space complexity, I clarified it was linear, only to be prompted by the interviewer with, “You mean O(1)?” No, I didn’t. These moments leave you questioning how the process is evaluated.

In my final interview, feedback claimed I was “stuck” on explaining a sorting algorithm. Yet I’d clearly explained bubble sort and its downsides, so this feedback felt unexpected. I wrapped up by asking thoughtful questions about what worked well with previous interns. Surprisingly, the interviewer said, “I don’t know; I haven’t worked with the intern team yet.” It was a disappointing lack of insight.

Hey guys, I'm from Netherlands in EU and I'm against these mandatory forced updates that Windows 11 pushes because sometimes some functions won't work, so I did some research and found a way to pause them for like 50 years.

Before it was that if you pause long the update, you cannot open images unless you update, or other minor things they would come up with to force it on you, but now it looks like they disabled my camera and I am redirected to update in order for it to work.

I have 2 laptops with the same method and issue so it's clearly what they do.

My question is: If I get a lawyer and go to court, and prove very clearly how they destroy my laptop for choosing out of my free not to update, do I have any chance of winning?

Thanks :)"

1gmvkn8,microsoft,Microsoft vs EY New Grad 2025,"Hi my post got deleted so here’s a repost 

Hey everyone!
I interned at Microsoft as a Program Manager in Redmond and got a return offer for a full-time role there. I also received an offer from EY in Atlanta as a Tech Risk Assurance Staff. The main reason I applied to EY was that I didn't really enjoy Seattle/Redmond, so the idea of moving to Atlanta is appealing.
A bit more about my situation: I'm an international student, so job security and sponsorship are super important to me. I'm also thinking about long-term career growth, which is another reason I'm considering EY. On the other hand, the work-life balance at Microsoft was great.
So here's my dilemma: Would you accept lower pay and a potentially more demanding job if you didn't like the city where the higher-paying job is located?
Here's the compensation breakdown:
Microsoft:
Base: $100,000 Stock: $9,000 Relocation: 6000 Lump sum
OR
the relocation package which is : one way flight 30 day temporary housing or up to $3000 in rent one month $750 allowance $5000 for furniture allowance or $3000 for bags

1glnb08,microsoft,Cyber security - Azure focused - guidance ,"
Hey everyone,

I’m currently working on a help desk and looking to transition into a cybersecurity role, ideally with a focus on Azure. I’m looking for advice on the best resources, certifications, and career roadmap to help me achieve this.

A bit of background: I’ve been prepping for security and networking basics with Professor Messer’s videos and practice exams, and I’m confident in my understanding of these areas—enough to handle most security questions in interviews. Initially, I was considering going for CompTIA certifications, but with the recent news about CompTIA’s acquisition, I’m hesitant to invest heavily in their certs right now.

So, my main questions are:
	1.	What are the best entry-level Azure certifications for someone aiming to move into cybersecurity? I want to start with beginner-friendly Azure certs but with a strong focus on security.
	2.	What’s a solid Azure-focused cybersecurity roadmap? I’m interested in hearing from those who have transitioned to a cyber role through an Azure path. What’s the progression like? Are there specific resources or learning paths you’d recommend?
	3.	Are there any must-have resources or communities (outside of Reddit) that would be valuable for someone pursuing this path? I’m open to books, online courses, labs, or anything else that can help me build a strong foundation.

The game in question is *Vanguard: Saga of Heroes*. It was developed by a small indie studio, backed by Sony and released WAY before it was ready in 2006 (just before or just after WoW's first expansion *The Burning Crusade*); according to the Wiki because Sony was tired of pouring money into it only to see nothing, according to gamers because Sony wanted to compete with WoW after EQII failed to do so in a meaningful way. It was released in a horribly buggy state, but still garnered a faithful following of dedicated players. Sony made some improvements over the years but mostly ignored it & sold it along with the rest of their PC gaming catalogue in 2015 to Columbus Nova.

* How to approach this properly?

* Will people that had those mailboxes attached to Outlook still have them as a way to look for previous mails or it will be removed automatically? I know that this depends how they were attached to the Outlook at the beginning.
* That newly created mailbox will be empty and how people would check for older mails?

*The team and workload was described as coming in flurries/waves, hectic/frantic, but with lots of opportunity to make an impact/provide immediate value.*

This seemed like a red flag at first, but perhaps it's normal. I'd describe my current environment in a similar fashion, but it can be hard to compare different interpretations; one person's ""hectic"" could be ""business as usual"" to someone else. 

Some additional questions that came to mind post-interview were:

* How are clock-ins and time tracked? I've heard about some tech companies using mouse or even eye-tracking technologies...is that really a thing?
* Are annual stock/RSU awards generally earned if you hit your goals, or only if you are in a top x% of performers? Do most employees expect to receive these every year?
* For those in remote positions, have you found it difficult to network internally and/or change teams if needed?

Any advice is appreciated. Is this only due to different job levels and how should I proceed? Can it negatively impact my application process if I send in multiple applications?"

1g9c71y,microsoft,User experience of Microsoft office products on Mac and Windows OS.,"I am a frequent user of Office products on Windows (HP Probook) and Mac (MacBook pro M3). I have the same 365 account signed into both devices and I find the user experience on the windows device to be horrible.

Editing a large file takes significantly longer to change on the windows, arbitrary freezes, copying and pasting bricks the entire system quite frequently. These are “features” I’ve almost never experienced on my MacBook.

However, I have been hunting for an SDE job for at least a year. So, I have applied to at least 1500 jobs in the past year, and several times to Microsft. Fortunately, this Wednesday I received an OA from a recruiter for a Microsoft IC2 role in the US. I also passed the OA on the same day. So, I might have final rounds in probably 10 days time. And, I really don't want to miss this opportunity, not just because I have been on the job hunt for 1 year, but also because it is MICROSOFT and I know this job can completely change my career trajectory.

For a little background, I have been solving DSA problems on leetcode for a year now, but more consistently for the past 3 months. I am familiar with most patterns and data structures, but still I am not expert level, I can only solve the not-so-complex medium questions. For statistics I have solved 454 problems on LC as of today, I have completed Grind 75, Grind 169 and Neetcode 75 lists and a few more problems.

However, I don't know much regarding System design especially HLD, and I only know the common design patterns in LLD. 

So, I am seeking out for advice from anyone who might shed some light on how should I prepare in this 10 days to maximize my chances of cracking the interview. I have heard the interview loop would consist of 3 or 4 45-minute interviews.

I also have some specific questions and if you can answer these it would be great.

1. Does grinding the most frequent Microsoft-tagged problems on Leetcode help? Can I only do that, and pray that they might ask me those? Also are there any fav data structures or algos for MSFT?

2. Do they ask System design problems for IC2 candidates, considering they are entry-level, and if so would they be LLD or HLD?

3. How difficult are the behavioral questions in Microsoft's interviews, are they like notoriously tough Amazon kinda LP questions are more generic ones that can be found on the internet?

Did anybody hear back from Microsoft? If yes then any help regarding the phone screening round would be appreciated. For example, what kind of questions do they ask, what to prepare for and what do they seek in a candidate.

Thanks for your help in advance. :)"

1g6ux7f,microsoft,Microsoft Resumes ,"I hope someone can help me please. 
I graduate in May but I'm willing to push back my graduation if that means I can get a Microsoft internship and return to work with them in December so I have been applying to full time and internship roles. However for internship roles resume I put December 2025 graduation date and for full time roles I put May 2025. My question is , is it just the one resume attached to your profile they look at or the one at the time of submission. I’m asking because I’m trying to tailor my resumes to match the Jo b description but MS only allows to upload one resume? If I update the resume based on the most recent job I applied to, will it affect the previous applications?

1g6l6ji,microsoft,Microsoft Job Application Status,"Hi all,

I tried to find a similar post on reddit but no luck so I'm making my own. I recently applied to a job at Microsoft. I checked the ""Action Center"" today and I had a notifcation saying my application was no longer being considered. I clicked to view more details and it brings me to an empty ""inactive"" folder. The application is currently still sat in submitted and in review. Has anyone else experienced this before? I'm just trying to figure out if I should move on or not. 

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

1g6hlkk,microsoft,Live Translation English/ Japanese on Teams,"My company is looking for a way to have real time translation between Japanese and English during Teams Meetings. We do have premium and are looking to try the ""live translation"" feature.

One main question:  
Do both parties on the Teams call need have premium for this to work? (We also want the Japanese speaking members to see a translation on their side).

Has anyone used this with Japanese/ English specifically and was it effective?

If this is not a feasible option, any recommendations for other software/ programs that can do this?
