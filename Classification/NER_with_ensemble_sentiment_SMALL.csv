In case you don‚Äôt remember, in 2019, Apple was accused of hiding the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on iPhone sales in China, battery discounts, and production cuts. Following this, $AAPL dropped 10%, and Apple faced a lawsuit from investors.



The good news is that Apple already settled $490M with investors, and they‚Äôre accepting late claims.



So here is a little FAQ for this settlement:¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

¬†¬†

Q. Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?

A. No, if you purchased $AAPL during the class period, you are eligible to file a claim.  
  


Q. How much money do I get per share?

A. The estimated payout is $1.33 per share, but the final amount will depend on how many shareholders file claims.



Q. Who can claim this settlement?

A. Anyone who purchased or otherwise acquired $AAPL including purchasers of Apple Inc. call options and sellers of Apple Inc. put options, from November 2, 2018, through January 2, 2019, inclusive.  


Q. How long does the payout process take?

A. It typically takes 8 to 12 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration.

If you followed Apple back in 2018, you probably remember the concerns about iPhone sales in China and the market‚Äôs reaction. If not, here‚Äôs a recap of what happened, and some updates.  
  


In November 2018, [Apple reported strong Q4 earnings](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/11/01/apple-inc-aapl-q4-2018-earnings-conference-call-tr.aspx) and projected record-breaking revenue for the next quarter. CEO Tim Cook dismissed concerns about weakening demand in China, reassuring investors that the company wasn‚Äôt seeing any issues in the region. However, just four days later, reports surfaced that Apple was cutting iPhone production due to weak demand, triggering analyst downgrades and a stock drop.

By January 2019, Apple confirmed what analysts had feared‚Äîit [slashed its revenue guidance by $9 billion](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/29/apple-profits-decline-iphone-sales-latest-news), citing slowing sales in China and economic challenges. The stock price, which had been $213 per share in November, dropped 33% to $142 in just three months, erasing $450 billion in market value.

Following the fallout, investors filed a lawsuit, accusing Apple of misleading them about iPhone demand and business conditions in China. The company already agreed to a $490 million settlement to resolve the case, and even though the deadline has passed, they‚Äôre accepting late claims. So, if you bought $AAPL stock back then, you may be eligible to [file a claim](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement) to recover some of your losses.



Since then, Apple has bounced back, hitting a $3.67 trillion market cap and expanding into AI. The company also recently announced $110 billion in share buybacks, reinforcing its commitment to returning value to shareholders.



Anyways, did you hold $AAPL shares during this rough period? How much did this impact you?

So, if you bought $AAPL stock back then, you may be eligible to [file a claim](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement) to recover some of your losses.



Since then, Apple has bounced back, hitting a $3.67 trillion market cap and expanding into AI. The company also recently announced $110 billion in share buybacks, reinforcing its commitment to returning value to shareholders.



Anyways, did you hold $AAPL shares during this rough period? How much did this impact you?

And just two months later, Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.



This led to multiple lawsuits accusing Apple of misleading investors. While Apple has consistently denied any wrongdoing, the company recently agreed to a $490M settlement, even before a court hearing.

In 2020 i thought that the widely rumoured ‚ÄûVision Ar/Vr‚Äú-Product would be the next catalyst - AVP is far far away of being a hit or a big part of Apples revenue‚Ä¶so: i was wrong in this case‚Ä¶

 I also thought that the highly anticipated ‚ÄûProject Titan‚Äú would be a huge booster for Apple. We all know, how this ended.

I couldn‚Äòt ever imagine that Apples ‚Äûnext big thing‚Äú would be AI and SatCom and i‚Äòm sure there is sooo much more to come, what we all can‚Äòt imagine.

In case you missed it, it's about Tim Cook‚Äôs comments about China‚Äôs sales back in 2018.So, if you checked the news in 2018, those comments were before the first Apple's revenue cut and loss of more than $70B with the stock fall.



During the call in the same 2018, he said that though Apple had sales problems in a few countries with high inflation rates (like Brazil and Russia), there were no such problems for China. But then, just a few days later, Apple cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.



And just two months later, Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.



This was the reason for several scandals and lawsuits based on Cook's comments, but Apple denied that they had any wrongdoing in this case (and they continue to deny it to this day).



So, this whole story is going to an end because recently Apple decided to pay $490M to investors due to the situation (even before the court hearing). And¬† I just found out that even though the deadline already passed, they are taking late claims on this. So if you were hit by this, you can [check it out](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).



However, does that half a billion even come close to covering the $70 billion loss? Especially with all the drama Apple's dealing with in China?

So I decided to add a small FAQ which (I hope) would help you.

1. Q\_ Do I need to sell my shares to get this settlement?

A\_ No, if you have purchased during the class period, you are eligible.

2. Q\_ How much money do I get per share?

A\_ You get around $1.33, but usually only 30% of all shareholders claim it, so you can get 3x more than this sum.

3. Q\_ Who can claim this settlement?

A\_ ""All persons that purchased or otherwise acquired the publicly traded securities of Apple Inc., including purchasers of Apple Inc. call options and sellers of Apple Inc. put options, during the period from November 2, 2018, through January 2, 2019, inclusive.""

4. Q\_ Lawyers will get all the money for this I won't get anything at the end of the day.

A\_ Lawyers already are getting paid, you'll lose only the money that you don't claim.

I was wondering what is going on in Apple stock since 2023 in comparison to the other ‚ÄöMagnificent 7‚Äò - yes we didn‚Äòt have any major breakthroughs to push revenue significantly higher - but the question i was asking myself: is this intentionally or is Apple REALLY out of ideas (i don‚Äòt think so).

In regards to the DOJ Lawsuit, it wouldn‚Äòt be a stupid strategic move to push the stock price lower to change the view on Apple. Wouldn‚Äòt it be more likely that the DOJ say ‚ÄûApple is a anticompetitive Monopoly‚Äú, when the stockprice would have outperformed the other Mag.7 & Apple is by far the most valuable company?
Now Apples move is to dive into cloudy water to mix up with the other average-performing ‚Äûfishes‚Äú, to offset the view on their business & valuation.

The question for us: When will Apple start the engine to come back into the crystal clear water, where they can poop in all the other faces that are behind them?üê†

1. iPhones are a status symbol in China. 
- Waning demand is not because of competition or lack of interest. People are generally not feeling as wealthy as they had been previously. Once the iPhone 16 come out, a lot of the demand that had been lost will be recovered. The Chinese sentiment for iPhone is strong. For example, most teens in China want a new iPhone for Christmas, but they are settling for other phones for now because economy has been bad for them.

2. Waning demand worries since 2011
- Investors have for 13 years said Apple has finally lost its ""magic"" and nobody wants them anymore. That is not true. Every year, there's a new investor that claims apple is finally going bust. But why is it always a new investor that claims this you say? Not sure. What happened to the guys who said $30 is too expensive? $40 is too expensive? $50? $60? $70? $80? Oh no - there is no way it's crossing $100, ""look at China's waning demand!!!"" It can't possibly cross the $150 mark! - what happened to all these guys? Did they get short squeezed? Not sure. I expect them to be too embarassed to ever speak again on matters of Apple. 

3. India as a new market in the next 3 years
- India is growing at a whopping pace. So far, the general public cannot afford iPhones as easily as those in China. If India's economy grows as expected, there will practically be ""2 Chinas"" in terms of cell phone demand. About a quarter to a half of that cellphone demand will be iPhones.

4. DOJ Lawsuit
- Legal payouts are nothing for the company's net profits. Several billions of dollars will be like a penny taken from a person's bank account. What investors should be worried about are injunctions, where courts legally stop Apple from forcing apps like Spotify to receive money through their App stores. This would be bad, since a lot of Apple's revenues are expected to come from commissions of those in-app purchases. The penalty damages though? Unless it's half a trillion dollars, some ridiculous amount that is more than 100s of billions, it won't really hurt Apple, especially not in the long run. 

5. Apple Cars Scrapped
- If it succeeded, it would have easily pushed the stock to above 200. However, a missed opportunity does not mean the stock itself is doomed. It's like you get into Harvard, that's great. If you don't get into Harvard, nothing really ""bad"" happens. There's still other Ivys, Stanford, MIT etc.

Also, just because it scrapped the project does not mean it's a useless endeavor. A lot of copyrighted tech and patents would have come from developing the apple cars. Just because we don't see the cars doesn't mean that R&D efforts are gone. Maybe we'll see better driving support apps and Siri support while driving. Or, maybe, we'll see more patents sold to car companies like Tesla or BYD.

6. Apple will someday fail like Nokia
- Very truly unlikely. Nokia has never been a high tech company. They have never been a status symbol. Rather, their selling points were cheap yet sturdy phones. Apple iPhones, on the other hand, along with Samsung Galaxies, are the Kings and Queens of the market with ultimate high tech where both could theoretically take a break for 2yrs+ and still other phone companies would not have caught up. 

Also, on top of Apple's tech, the company has settled as a status symbol. Just like a luxury good, you can't get rid of the affordable prestige that apple products give. You can't replicate it. Compare this to Motorola or Blackberries. Motorola had great design features but no tech, Blackberries had security and a symbol of business, yet they were not appealing. Apple has all of those - appealing design, high tech, services. 

7. AI Weakness
- Among the Fantastic 7 stocks, Apple is a bit behind. However, this is not an issue. Apple always has opportunities to purchase high tech midsized firms for cheap. In the worst case scenario, Apple can license such AI tech from competitors such as Google while earning time to catchup with their own proprietary tech.

8. Interest rates of the Fed
- This is a true short term risk. If the Fed does not lower the interest rate at least twice during the year, iPhone sales will not skyrocket. However, if interest rate is lowered at least 2 times in 2024, iPhone sales across the world will skyrocket since the effect of Fed interest rates will increase liquidity to an astonishing amount, making all those who were saving up and hoping for an iPhone monetarily empowered to buy the iPhones.

Conclusion)
If Fed lowers the interest rate at least two times by end of the year, China's increased demand for iPhones will dwarf the worries of waning demand. Also, iPhone sales across the globe will increase so much that Apple's stock will easily cross the $200 mark. Everything else is noise and comments made by ""General"" ""Jack of all trades"" stock investors who don't understand Apple as a company and its trademark.

Worst case scenario
1) Less than 2 interest rate drops
2) DOJ injunction on in-app purchases mandate
3) Trump election -> Trump's America First can bankrupt Apple if he goes too far. Apple phones are produced at $9/phone and is sold for $999. Even though that looks like a lot, the profit after paying for US workers and operation is only 25%.

Producing all iPhones in the US will easily increase cost per production to $100/phone. This can lower profit margins to lower than 15%.

This is an extreme scenario that is unlikely to occur even if Trump were to be elected.

Any of these worst case scenarios can lower the stock to below $150.

Look for those who are worried dont be and take a deep breath. First this DOJ lawsuit had been in the works for a long time. ,"This was not a surprise. The average  daily shares traded on Apple is around 79 million today it hovered around 106. If this was ground breaking news it would have traded alot more than 106. Second think algorithms. Yep those damn algorithms. Third the government has had 3 lawsuits over the last 14 years against Apple and they have lost every single one. The most recent was Fortnite. Guys listen closely go read the District Court of Appeals in California  and Supreme Court Justice Sotormayer‚Äôs decision (she represents that Dustrict) - she basically told Fortnight to go to hell. (In so many words - just go read the decision) The Supreme Court does not like this kinda crap when the government intervenes like this. Now look the govt is claiming an anti trust lawsuit. Bahahah Well no because anti trust ONLY applies to you and I - the consumer not an app developer or anything else that doesnt apply to the everyday consumer. And as far as choices of phones there are lots of choices of phones but out of 330 million people in the US 62% choose on their own free will Iphones and it is reported  each consumer has at least two types of apple devices. So the government is going to interfere with all those consumers and their devices. Can you imagine? It is purely disgusting. They are trying to control people‚Äôs choices in phones. And you know they are just waiting to bite at Apple working with Google in generative AI. You literally have to see how political this is. The good news is - The govt‚Äôs lawyers are just that govt lawyers - Apple lawyers are bulldogs who will crush them like a bug. The anti trust laws are on apple‚Äôs side. In addition this will at least take four years like all the other cases the govt has against Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon. Biden has made it his passion since day one to go after big tech., But when you have the entire supreme court against what the govt is doing in the end it will all work out. You cant crap on these companies because in the end it all ends up crapping on you the consumer. So just sit tight. Hopefully with a little luck these lawsuits may go away by next year.

But then, just a few days later, Apple decided to cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.

Analysts including Dan Ives said iPhone users are likely to upgrade despite the expected $100 price increase on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models as US carriers are projected to offer massive discounts and promotions that ""will take the sting of a slight price increase away"" over the coming months.

* Wall Street has started its annual look-ahead predictions for next year, and Wedbush Securities is bullish on several themes, including continued growth from Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), Alphabet (NASDAQ:[GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) and other big tech companies.
* Analyst Dan Ives believes that some of the recent volatility the stock market has seen is no more than a ""painful digestion period \[along with Omicron fears\],"" as earnings estimates now factor in a hawkish Fed and some stretched valuations for tech stocks. However, Ives is bullish on tech stocks for next year.
* As part of his prediction list, Ives believes Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) will unveil its long-awaited and oft-speculated AR/VR headset Apple Glasses in the summer, which will ""result in another major growth catalyst for the stock"" as the world's most valuable company continues to monetize its user base.
* Ives also thinks that the broader NASDAQ ([COMP.IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP.IND?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), represented by the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:[QQQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), is likely to hit 19,000 by the year-end, up from around its current level of 15,400, as the digital transformation between businesses and consumers continues. He adds that the underlying growth prospects for the broader tech sector are between two and three times the normalized or historical patterns.
* The [metaverse](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3778822-how-to-invest-in-the-metaverse?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews), an idea that has been bandied about for nearly 30 years, seems poised to move from hype to reality, Ives suggests, as companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:[FB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FB?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), Google ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) and Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) invest ""billions"" of dollars over the next year in this space, with ""significant"" amounts of merger activity likely to come.
* Ives also thinks that the cloud arms race will stay heated, as the entrants go after $1 trillion in spending over the next decade. He believes that more than 50% of workloads will be on the cloud by the end of 2022, up from 43% currently, largely benefting Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) and Google ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), followed by Oracle (NYSE:[ORCL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) and IBM (NYSE:[IBM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)).
* Cybersecurity budgets appear poised to increase sharply next year, Ives predicts, rising 21% in 2022, or about 1% above a ""robust"" year in 2021. As such, he believes companies like Zscaler (NASDAQ:[ZS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZS?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), Tenable (NYSE:[TEN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TEN?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), CyberArk (NASDAQ:[CYBR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CYBR?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), Varonis (NASDAQ:[VRNS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRNS?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), Sailpoint (NYSE:[SAIL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAIL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)), Fortinet (NASDAQ:[FTNT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FTNT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:[PANW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PANW?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)).
* Despite what is likely to be a rising interest rate environment, tech companies will likely continue to spend and acquire in significant fashion next year, Ives believes.

* On the macro front, Ives thinks that the chip shortage, particularly out of Asia, will ""significantly moderate"" in the first half of the year. Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) and the chip companies - Ives did name any specific ones - are the ""best springboard bets to benefit from this key dynamic easing.""
* Keeping in-line with broader ideas, Ives thinks that the regulatory environment in the U.S. and Europe will be a threat to the big-tech companies around anti-trust and monopoly concerns, but instead of structural changes, it is likely to largely wind up in the companies being fined, and potentially hampering their ability to buy or acquire other companies.
* Ives also thinks that Chinese tech companies will continue to be a ""very treacherous"" space for global investors, as the government continues to crackdown on companies. As such, this could result in more dollars coming out of Chinese tech stocks and rotating into U.S. tech stocks.
* Lastly, Ives thinks Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) will reach a $3 trillion market cap next year, to be followed thereafter by Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)).

* Apple stock has risen 34% this year, beating the NASDAQ 100 by a wide margin.
* This has led some to say that the stock is in a bubble, as its price is rising rapidly.

**Apple Inc.** ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) stock has delivered a solid performance in 2021. Up 35% for the year, it has solidly outperformed both the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500. The latest in a long streak of winning years for the company, Apple‚Äôs 2021 shows that a stock is never too big to beat the market.

With that said, there‚Äôs no shortage of people who think Apple‚Äôs winning run is due for a correction. In recent weeks, we‚Äôve seen a deluge of articles claiming that AAPL is overvalued, with titles like:

Not all of these articles have been unambiguously bearish. A few mention positives along with negatives. But generally speaking, the sentiment that Apple is a bubble, or at least overvalued, is becoming common. If you look at [TipRanks‚Äô sentiment chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/stock-investors), it shows decisively negative sentiment toward Apple stock.

The bearishness of investor sentiment toward Apple becomes clear when we compare it to the sentiment toward **Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FB?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)). Meta, a company that is being sued for antitrust violations and getting attacked in the press daily, has a nearly perfect sentiment score. So there is no special tech curse that guarantees negative sentiment toward individual stocks in the sector. Apple‚Äôs sentiment problem is indeed its own problem.

üì∑

Which begs the question:

*Why?*

Apple is a wide-moat stock, one of the few tech companies that controls both hardware and software for most of its users. Many companies have attempted to copy Apple‚Äôs strategy of maximizing revenue by integrating hardware and apps, but few have succeeded at it. If you want the IOS or Mac OS experience, you need an iPhone or Mac. And billions of people want those experiences enough to pay top dollar for Apple‚Äôs products. Few other tech companies have that advantage ‚Äì **Nintendo** ([OTCPK:NTDOY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTDOY?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) being one exception, if you count gaming as tech.

This makes Apple arguably a [wide-moat stock](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4471157-apple-widening-its-moat?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link). You need Apple hardware to run Apple software, and people like Apple software. This gives Apple a ‚Äúmonopoly‚Äù on a certain collection of software experiences. It does not have a monopoly on any particular device category, but it‚Äôs the only company that can provide the integrated [Apple ecosystem](https://techjourneyman.com/blog/apple-ecosystem-explained/).

This advantage has paid dividends to Apple shareholders ‚Äì both figuratively and literally. Apple is the world‚Äôs biggest company by market cap and the [fourth-biggest by revenue](https://companiesmarketcap.com/largest-companies-by-revenue/). Its revenue growth rate has slowed in recent years, but certain segments (such as watches and services) are growing faster than ever. It appears, then, that Apple still has the potential for significant profitability and growth. Accordingly, I‚Äôll develop a bullish thesis on Apple in this article, arguing that its solid economic moat provides potential for its stock to appreciate in the future.

## Competitive Landscape

One of the most important things to understand about Apple is its competitive position. The company operates in such a wide variety of different markets that it‚Äôs hard to pin down its business beyond simply ‚Äútech.‚Äù Technically, the company‚Äôs SIC Code (industry classification) is 7372, denoting ‚Äúprepackaged software.‚Äù However, this doesn‚Äôt capture the full extent of Apple‚Äôs business activities, as it‚Äôs also involved in hardware, semiconductors, [payments](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) and entertainment.

Some of Apple‚Äôs most noteworthy competitors include:

* **Samsung** ([OTC:SSNLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) - smartphones.
* **Huawei** \- smartphones.
* **Alphabet** ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) - smartphones, laptops, and software.
* **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) - laptops.
* **Dell** (NYSE:[DELL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) - laptops.
* **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADBE?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) - creative software.
* And many more.

A comprehensive list of Apple‚Äôs competitors would be impossible to come up with, because the company operates in so many different verticals. In addition to all the names above, Apple is arguably in competition with the big semi companies, as it sells phones and laptops with Apple chips. Apple is one of the most comprehensive tech companies around, with a massive lineup of hardware, software and services, putting it in tacit competition with dozens of companies.

How is Apple doing in the industries it competes in? According to [Counterpoint Research](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share/) and Statista, Apple‚Äôs market shares include:

* Smartphones: 47% in the US and 14% globally.
* Laptops: 15% in the US and 7.6% globally.
* Smartwatches: over 50% globally.
* Tablets: 35% globally.

On the whole, Apple is in first or second place in most of its markets. It‚Äôs behind Samsung on smartphone sales but it leads in watches and tablets. This is a pretty good market position. And it could grow over time. Some of Apple‚Äôs product categories are still fairly new. The company only just recently broke into smart watches and [sales in the category are growing at 50%](https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2021/05/apple-watch-recorded-50-year-over-year-growth-in-q1-21-to-maintain-its-global-smartwatch-leadership.html). Apple has taken heat lately for its slowing growth, but certain products within the company‚Äôs lineup are growing faster than ever. This provides potential for strong growth well into the future.

## The M1 Chip and Apple Services

Speaking of future growth, it‚Äôs worth exploring two of Apple‚Äôs most promising categories:

*The M1 Chip and Apple Services.*

The M1 Chip (really the M1 family of chips now) is a new chip designed by Apple based on ARM architecture. The base configuration boasts:

* An 8-core CPU.
* A 7-core GPU.
* 8 or 16 gigs of RAM (physically built into the chip).
* 5nm process.
* 16 billion transistors.
* 3.2 GHZ max clock rate.

Incredible specs. And on top of that, there are two new models‚Äìthe M1 Pro and M1 Max‚Äìthat offer improvements on the base model. It would be tedious to list detailed spec sheets for these higher end models, but one eye-popping stat is the M1 Max‚Äôs 57 billion transistors. This competes with the CPUs included in extremely high end gaming PCs. And of course, that makes newer Macs themselves viable as gaming rigs, as countless [YouTube reviewers have noted](https://youtu.be/szTQPLG-IvU). Apple already has a sizable market share in laptops and desktops, but with the M1 chip family, it now has a shot at capturing the gaming segment as well. Until now, that market segment has proven elusive to Apple. So, there is significant potential for accelerating growth in Apple‚Äôs computer lineup.

Next up is Apple services. This is a broad category that includes streaming music, movies, books and more. This category is always expanding and could potentially drive more growth after hardware growth slows down. In the most recent quarter, service growth actually [lagged product growth](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21_Q4_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf), at 25% vs 30% for the latter. However, services are promising because they‚Äôre a category that could continue to grow even after hardware products reach their total addressable market. Global smartphone sales have been [flat-lining after years of strong growth](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263437/global-smartphone-sales-to-end-users-since-2007/). In this environment, it would be unrealistic to expect Apple‚Äôs hardware sales to grow as fast as they did in the past. But by selling more services to existing customers, Apple can keep growing its total revenue even as hardware sales underwhelm.

## Financials and Valuation

Now we can turn to Apple‚Äôs financials.

Apple‚Äôs most recent quarter was a [miss on both revenue and earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/earnings?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link); however, the results were strong in absolute terms. In the quarter, Apple delivered:

* $83 billion in revenue, up 29%.  

* $27.3 billion in operating income, up 60%.
* $20.5 billion in net income, up 63%.
* $1.24 in diluted EPS, up 69%.

The company also reported $104 billion in TTM cash from operations in its fourth quarter report. That was up 28% from the year before.

These were pretty solid results. Especially for a mature company. Apple is the biggest company in the world by market cap, yet its revenue and earnings are both up by growth stock levels. And this one quarter wasn‚Äôt a fluke. According to [Seeking Alpha Quant](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/growth?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link), Apple‚Äôs five-year CAGR growth rates in the metrics listed above are:

* Revenue: 11%.
* Operating income: 12.7%.
* Net income: 15.7%.
* Diluted EPS: 22%.
* Cash flow: 10.7%.

Again very solid for a mature company. It does look like the most recent quarter was better than average, but the long-term metrics are still very good. Which gets to the heart of this article‚Äôs thesis:

Apple is definitely not a bubble stock. Its valuation is fairly steep, as it trades at 30 times earnings, 7.7 times sales, and 26 times cash flow. But the company still has plenty of growth potential. Compounded annually, its earnings are growing at 22%, and as the most recent quarter showed, it has room for acceleration. If you factor in both growth and value, you get a [PEG ratio of just 0.43](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/valuation/metrics?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) for the trailing 12-month period. That‚Äôs far from a bubble valuation. In fact, it looks downright cheap.

## Risks and Challenges

While Apple is definitely an ultra-profitable company with strong growth and a moderate valuation, its stock is not without its risks. As a major hardware company, it is vulnerable to supply chain issues, and other shocks. Some major risks and challenges to the bullish thesis outlined in this article include:

* **Supply chain issues.** The world is currently going through a chip shortage, as well as shortages of various other hi-tech parts. These problems are affecting Apple. Just recently, the company [slashed iPhone production](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/07/nikkei-apple-supply-chain-issues/) because of supply chain issues. That right before the crucial Holiday season, no less. These kinds of problems are an ever-present threat for a hardware company like Apple, which depends on a ready supply of raw materials to keep sales flowing.
* **Scale.** Mathematically, the bigger something gets, the larger of an increase is needed to drive percentage gains equal to past ones. If you start selling $1,000 widgets and sell one your first year, you double your sales just by selling $2,000 worth the next year. If, however, ten years later, you‚Äôre selling $332 billion worth, you need customers to come up with $664 billion in the eleventh year to achieve the same growth. This is mathematically unlikely. And as it just so happens, Apple‚Äôs $83 billion Q4 revenue annualizes to $332 billion. So growth will be harder to achieve going forward.
* **Disruption.** Apple‚Äôs business model requires that it stay on the leading edge of tech innovation. If another company comes out with something decisively superior to the iPhone, that could kill Apple‚Äôs business overnight. Apple itself [did this once](https://www.imore.com/how-apple-killed-blackberry), to **BlackBerry** ([BB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BB?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)), makers of the ill-fated BlackBerry Smartphone. The history of the tech industry is littered with companies eating each other's lunch, and while Apple has billions to spend on R&D, you never know where the next threat will come from.

The above are some very real risks for investors to keep in mind. The supply chain risk, in particular, is very real, having been cited as a problem in several quarterly reports. With that said, Apple stock has an incredible moat, decent growth, and a not-unreasonable valuation. This is definitely not a stock to short. And while the gains realized by longs will not be as good in the future as they were in the past, they should still be decent.","Apple Stock Is No Bubble [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4476363-apple-stock-no-bubble](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4476363-apple-stock-no-bubble)

Its revenue growth rate has slowed in recent years, but certain segments (such as watches and services) are growing faster than ever. It appears, then, that Apple still has the potential for significant profitability and growth. Accordingly, I‚Äôll develop a bullish thesis on Apple in this article, arguing that its solid economic moat provides potential for its stock to appreciate in the future.

## Competitive Landscape

One of the most important things to understand about Apple is its competitive position. The company operates in such a wide variety of different markets that it‚Äôs hard to pin down its business beyond simply ‚Äútech.‚Äù Technically, the company‚Äôs SIC Code (industry classification) is 7372, denoting ‚Äúprepackaged software.‚Äù However, this doesn‚Äôt capture the full extent of Apple‚Äôs business activities, as it‚Äôs also involved in hardware, semiconductors, [payments](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) and entertainment.

Some of Apple‚Äôs most noteworthy competitors include:

* **Samsung** ([OTC:SSNLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) - smartphones.
* **Huawei** \- smartphones.
* **Alphabet** ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) - smartphones, laptops, and software.
* **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) - laptops.
* **Dell** (NYSE:[DELL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) - laptops.
* **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADBE?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) - creative software.
* And many more.

A comprehensive list of Apple‚Äôs competitors would be impossible to come up with, because the company operates in so many different verticals. In addition to all the names above, Apple is arguably in competition with the big semi companies, as it sells phones and laptops with Apple chips. Apple is one of the most comprehensive tech companies around, with a massive lineup of hardware, software and services, putting it in tacit competition with dozens of companies.

How is Apple doing in the industries it competes in? According to [Counterpoint Research](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share/) and Statista, Apple‚Äôs market shares include:

* Smartphones: 47% in the US and 14% globally.
* Laptops: 15% in the US and 7.6% globally.
* Smartwatches: over 50% globally.
* Tablets: 35% globally.

On the whole, Apple is in first or second place in most of its markets. It‚Äôs behind Samsung on smartphone sales but it leads in watches and tablets. This is a pretty good market position. And it could grow over time. Some of Apple‚Äôs product categories are still fairly new. The company only just recently broke into smart watches and [sales in the category are growing at 50%](https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2021/05/apple-watch-recorded-50-year-over-year-growth-in-q1-21-to-maintain-its-global-smartwatch-leadership.html). Apple has taken heat lately for its slowing growth, but certain products within the company‚Äôs lineup are growing faster than ever. This provides potential for strong growth well into the future.

## The M1 Chip and Apple Services

Speaking of future growth, it‚Äôs worth exploring two of Apple‚Äôs most promising categories:

*The M1 Chip and Apple Services.*

The M1 Chip (really the M1 family of chips now) is a new chip designed by Apple based on ARM architecture. The base configuration boasts:

* An 8-core CPU.
* A 7-core GPU.
* 8 or 16 gigs of RAM (physically built into the chip).
* 5nm process.
* 16 billion transistors.
* 3.2 GHZ max clock rate.

Incredible specs. And on top of that, there are two new models‚Äìthe M1 Pro and M1 Max‚Äìthat offer improvements on the base model. It would be tedious to list detailed spec sheets for these higher end models, but one eye-popping stat is the M1 Max‚Äôs 57 billion transistors. This competes with the CPUs included in extremely high end gaming PCs. And of course, that makes newer Macs themselves viable as gaming rigs, as countless [YouTube reviewers have noted](https://youtu.be/szTQPLG-IvU). Apple already has a sizable market share in laptops and desktops, but with the M1 chip family, it now has a shot at capturing the gaming segment as well. Until now, that market segment has proven elusive to Apple. So, there is significant potential for accelerating growth in Apple‚Äôs computer lineup.

Next up is Apple services. This is a broad category that includes streaming music, movies, books and more. This category is always expanding and could potentially drive more growth after hardware growth slows down. In the most recent quarter, service growth actually [lagged product growth](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21_Q4_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf), at 25% vs 30% for the latter. However, services are promising because they‚Äôre a category that could continue to grow even after hardware products reach their total addressable market. Global smartphone sales have been [flat-lining after years of strong growth](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263437/global-smartphone-sales-to-end-users-since-2007/). In this environment, it would be unrealistic to expect Apple‚Äôs hardware sales to grow as fast as they did in the past. But by selling more services to existing customers, Apple can keep growing its total revenue even as hardware sales underwhelm.

## Financials and Valuation

Now we can turn to Apple‚Äôs financials.

Apple‚Äôs most recent quarter was a [miss on both revenue and earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/earnings?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link); however, the results were strong in absolute terms. In the quarter, Apple delivered:

* $83 billion in revenue, up 29%.  

* $27.3 billion in operating income, up 60%.
* $20.5 billion in net income, up 63%.
* $1.24 in diluted EPS, up 69%.

The company also reported $104 billion in TTM cash from operations in its fourth quarter report. That was up 28% from the year before.

These were pretty solid results. Especially for a mature company. Apple is the biggest company in the world by market cap, yet its revenue and earnings are both up by growth stock levels. And this one quarter wasn‚Äôt a fluke. According to [Seeking Alpha Quant](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/growth?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link), Apple‚Äôs five-year CAGR growth rates in the metrics listed above are:

* Revenue: 11%.
* Operating income: 12.7%.
* Net income: 15.7%.
* Diluted EPS: 22%.
* Cash flow: 10.7%.

Again very solid for a mature company. It does look like the most recent quarter was better than average, but the long-term metrics are still very good. Which gets to the heart of this article‚Äôs thesis:

Apple is definitely not a bubble stock. Its valuation is fairly steep, as it trades at 30 times earnings, 7.7 times sales, and 26 times cash flow. But the company still has plenty of growth potential. Compounded annually, its earnings are growing at 22%, and as the most recent quarter showed, it has room for acceleration. If you factor in both growth and value, you get a [PEG ratio of just 0.43](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/valuation/metrics?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) for the trailing 12-month period. That‚Äôs far from a bubble valuation. In fact, it looks downright cheap.

## Risks and Challenges

While Apple is definitely an ultra-profitable company with strong growth and a moderate valuation, its stock is not without its risks. As a major hardware company, it is vulnerable to supply chain issues, and other shocks. Some major risks and challenges to the bullish thesis outlined in this article include:

* **Supply chain issues.** The world is currently going through a chip shortage, as well as shortages of various other hi-tech parts. These problems are affecting Apple. Just recently, the company [slashed iPhone production](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/07/nikkei-apple-supply-chain-issues/) because of supply chain issues. That right before the crucial Holiday season, no less. These kinds of problems are an ever-present threat for a hardware company like Apple, which depends on a ready supply of raw materials to keep sales flowing.
* **Scale.** Mathematically, the bigger something gets, the larger of an increase is needed to drive percentage gains equal to past ones. If you start selling $1,000 widgets and sell one your first year, you double your sales just by selling $2,000 worth the next year. If, however, ten years later, you‚Äôre selling $332 billion worth, you need customers to come up with $664 billion in the eleventh year to achieve the same growth. This is mathematically unlikely. And as it just so happens, Apple‚Äôs $83 billion Q4 revenue annualizes to $332 billion. So growth will be harder to achieve going forward.
* **Disruption.** Apple‚Äôs business model requires that it stay on the leading edge of tech innovation. If another company comes out with something decisively superior to the iPhone, that could kill Apple‚Äôs business overnight. Apple itself [did this once](https://www.imore.com/how-apple-killed-blackberry), to **BlackBerry** ([BB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BB?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)), makers of the ill-fated BlackBerry Smartphone. The history of the tech industry is littered with companies eating each other's lunch, and while Apple has billions to spend on R&D, you never know where the next threat will come from.

The above are some very real risks for investors to keep in mind. The supply chain risk, in particular, is very real, having been cited as a problem in several quarterly reports. With that said, Apple stock has an incredible moat, decent growth, and a not-unreasonable valuation. This is definitely not a stock to short. And while the gains realized by longs will not be as good in the future as they were in the past, they should still be decent.",,0.003233083,2219,746,AAPL Stock Is No Bubble https seekingalpha com

&#x200B;

* Peak investor optimism on Apple shares looks to be coinciding with peak earnings, which is incredibly bearish for 2022-23.
* Any problems with Apple's supply chain coming out of China or related to a drop in consumer spending could slash margins next year.
* Analyst estimates for long-term results are already highlighting the potential for real downside in Apple.
* Other risks include rising inflation and interest rates, in addition to the high odds of a major bear market on Wall Street, following the end of 2020-21 free-money government giveaways to fight the pandemic.  


&#x200B;

I admit to being *Neutral* to *Bearish* on **Apple** ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) over the past year, incorrectly so. I do not own shares, and have shorted Apple for days or weeks at a time on several occasions. My family owns five or six Apple products. I don‚Äôt have any knock against its leading gadgets, smartphones and computers to explain my negative view of the stock.

My pessimism/bearishness is part of a contrarian investment slant. I am a skeptic and like to play devil‚Äôs advocate in my investment process. I am also an investor/analyst that participated in the last technology boom ending in 1999-2000. In my experienced opinion (with numerous other financial market experts coming to the same conclusion in 2021), Apple‚Äôs current price/value, approaching an American record $3 trillion for equity market capitalization, looks destined to fall appreciably in 2022-23.

Not only is Apple today discounted at its greatest overvaluation in history on a variety of fundamental/trading metrics, but robust profit margins on peaking income growth are part of the investment puzzle going into next year. This peak on a peak setup is nearly identical to the last bubble top in technology names, which was followed by an 80% drop in Big Tech between 2000-02, as measured by the **Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF** ([QQQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)). Arguing Apple is not in a bubble when looking at super-confident Wall Street sentiment and absurd valuations on a low-growth future may prove quite foolhardy soon.

You have to go back to the[ *Standard Oil*](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/chart-evolution-standard-oil/), Rockefeller years a good century ago to find another company valuation that represented a similar percentage of the U.S. economy. \[The crazy point to contemplate is **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)), **Alphabet** ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) are not far behind.\] My question to Apple shareholders is how can the company mathematically grow much in value, when it is reaching for the point where government antitrust action has erupted in the past? Apple‚Äôs business worth stands at a gargantuan 10% of U.S. GDP output annually, a record 7% of S&P 500 index capitalization, and a previously unimaginable 12% weighting in the [NASDAQ 100 Big Tech index](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link).

*Food for Thought*: roughly 10% of the net S&P 500 advance from early 2019 has been generated by Apple alone.

Below is a graph of the uncharted territory Apple‚Äôs simple fundamental valuation has reached in 2020-21. On basic price to trailing metrics, the stock is valued at 2x to 8x its 10-year averages on earnings, sales, cash flow and book value!

## Peak Earnings in 2021-22?

If you knew nothing about Apple, and just reviewed the above chart, a rational experienced investor would instantly assume huge growth rates for the underlying business were just now beginning. Nope. Wall Street analysts are expecting only subpar/minor, if any real growth (adjusted for inflation) in the underlying business. Below are charts of the projected stagnation in annual EPS and revenues for Apple after 2021.

Even the jump in profit margins, which has helped produce the massive bump higher in the stock quote since 2019, can be read negatively for future pricing. What if margin pressures from supply-chain issues out of China (either from Omicron exploding in China or trade tensions with America expanding) raise costs more than competitors, and consumers globally slow spending decisions (falling from the record disposable income rate of 2021, artificially pumped by government stimulus programs). Both variable cost and demand pressures could drag down profit margins in 2022-23, making any net income ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù in the business almost impossible.

üì∑

My worry is Apple should logically be trading near its LOWEST valuation on trailing results, if above-normal business growth trends have peaked, not many multiples of normal! Given Apple fails to deliver any uptick in EPS and sales during 2022, the stock could easily be marked down to reality. Believe it or not, a 50% or even 70% price decline cannot mathematically be ruled out, if a deep consumer spending recession or spike in interest rates to match 7% CPI inflation plays out next year.

## Year 2000 Bubble Peak Repeat?

To illustrate my research conclusion, we can go back in time to the 1990s Dotcom boom peak for Big Tech. Microsoft, **Intel** ([INTC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) and **Cisco** ([CSCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) were the backbone of the early internet and sprouting computer age during the 1990s decade. Just like the cryptocurrency craze of today, where assets of little worth outside of speculative trading schemes are bid into the millions or even billions for value, any company starting a website that seemed to have reasonable odds of catching on with consumers or businesses became on overnight success in the late 1990s. Investors both then and now were hungry to grab quick profits and wealth. Wall Street sentiment was almost identical to today, in terms of easy money was everywhere you looked, ripe for the picking.

Below is a chart of the red-hot technology companies that drove the advance during the late 1990s on a log scale, reaching gains in the thousands of percent for the decade. Sound familiar? Microsoft, Intel and Cisco far outstripped the equivalent S&P 500 total return riding the up elevator, with only minor corrections along the way.

üì∑By early 2000, the three drove market gains from their truly monster size at the bubble peak. Each achieved a 4% weighting high in the S&P 500, which was a modern record for any single company two decades ago. However, after the tech bubble deflated over a span of several years, each dramatically ""underperformed"" the S&P 500 over the next 10 years.

Below I have drawn some comparison charts starting on January 14th, 2000 into December 2005. Owning these previous ""cannot miss"" winners turned into a complete investment disaster for those unlucky enough to rush into the Big Tech names at a long-term top.

üì∑üì∑üì∑The message for today's investor - sometimes the biggest gainers on Wall Street over the recent past can morph into major losers for a number of years. What investors at the 1999-2000 peak failed to realize or understand was free market forces eventually bring extensive competition to highly profitable industries. Plus, capital flow cycles are not a one-way street. When investor interest becomes exhausted, a downside cycle of sellers swamping buyers begins. The Double Whammy of 2000 was peak tech valuations were reached at the same moment as peak business profitability, perhaps mimicking the Apple condition of late 2021.

## Final Thoughts

Extended price gains on peak earnings for Apple have translated into an explosion in forward PEG valuations throughout 2021 (P/Es divided by expected Earnings Growth). While one could argue PEG numbers closer to 1x were a good reason to buy Apple‚Äôs still overvalued stock position in December 2020, that is clearly not the case today.

üì∑

The current outlandish PEG readings on nearly flat earnings in coming years are actually screaming at smart long-term owners to dump Apple. It‚Äôs really a worst-case scenario for Apple investors‚Ä¶ *a Peak Valuation on Peak Earnings*. This Double Whammy condition is quite rare for shareholders. The best parallel for Apple today may be the important long-term stock tops during 1999-2000 for the leading Big Tech names.

It appears the Federal Reserve‚Äôs unchecked money printing, and Uncle Sam‚Äôs record stimulus to fight the pandemic have pulled forward 3-5 years of economic activity and optimism. Now we are saddled with record debt and spiking inflation to deal with. If you want to think outside the Wall Street box of perpetual optimism currently, why not expect an equally wicked downturn in stocks next year to counterbalance the record-breaking 100%+ price advance in U.S. equity index quotes from the pandemic panic selling low? That would be nice symmetry, regressing stocks to mean valuations and pricing, while resetting the market for another upcycle. How many newbie investors understand that could be our reality during 2022?

Apple itself could be a leader on the downside for investor pain (after leading on the upside), especially if economic tensions with China rise, or something worse takes place regarding Taiwan independence over the coming 6-12 months. Such would wreak havoc on Apple‚Äôs China-Taiwan centric supply chain, which I have discussed in past articles.

What kind of potential upside remains in Apple? That‚Äôs a good question. I would estimate very little good news is coming for Apple investors. Could the stock reach for $200 a share, before reversing hard and tanking back to $100 over the next 12-18 months? I think such a trading move is entirely possible. Mania-entrenched investors can definitely create a nuttier overvaluation position, before free market forces go horribly wrong for leveraged/wild equity market speculators (either sharply higher inflation and interest rates, or a much slower U.S. economy than analysts are now forecasting could puncture the Big Tech bubble). A continued Apple up-move would smack of heightened year 2000-like trouble and future R-I-S-K.

If you own shares, I believe it prudent to whittle back your position. If you cannot talk yourself into selling all your shares, liquidating a quarter or half of your position will help you sleep at night when prices start to implode (and they will eventually from unsustainably lofty heights). I have a ‚Äúfair value‚Äù price range of $85-125 for Apple, depending on the inflation and interest picture for 2022, how its supply-chain handles change, and whether consumer spending patterns for electronic/digital devices can sustain themselves at elevated levels.","Apple Reaching For Double Whammy Top - Peak Valuation On Peak Earnings [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4476804-apple-aapl-reaching-double-whammy-top-peak-valuation-peak-earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4476804-apple-aapl-reaching-double-whammy-top-peak-valuation-peak-earnings)

* Peak investor optimism on Apple shares looks to be coinciding with peak earnings, which is incredibly bearish for 2022-23.
* Any problems with Apple's supply chain coming out of China or related to a drop in consumer spending could slash margins next year.
* Analyst estimates for long-term results are already highlighting the potential for real downside in Apple.
* Other risks include rising inflation and interest rates, in addition to the high odds of a major bear market on Wall Street, following the end of 2020-21 free-money government giveaways to fight the pandemic.

I admit to being *Neutral* to *Bearish* on **Apple** ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) over the past year, incorrectly so. I do not own shares, and have shorted Apple for days or weeks at a time on several occasions. My family owns five or six Apple products. I don‚Äôt have any knock against its leading gadgets, smartphones and computers to explain my negative view of the stock.

My pessimism/bearishness is part of a contrarian investment slant. I am a skeptic and like to play devil‚Äôs advocate in my investment process. I am also an investor/analyst that participated in the last technology boom ending in 1999-2000. In my experienced opinion (with numerous other financial market experts coming to the same conclusion in 2021), Apple‚Äôs current price/value, approaching an American record $3 trillion for equity market capitalization, looks destined to fall appreciably in 2022-23.

Not only is Apple today discounted at its greatest overvaluation in history on a variety of fundamental/trading metrics, but robust profit margins on peaking income growth are part of the investment puzzle going into next year. This peak on a peak setup is nearly identical to the last bubble top in technology names, which was followed by an 80% drop in Big Tech between 2000-02, as measured by the **Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF** ([QQQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)).

Consistency has always been the name of the game with Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))

It's one of the rare companies that can release a barely noticeable update to a product millions of people have - and then somehow convince them it's important enough that they have to go buy another one every year.

And even in years where its flagship iPhone doesn't light the sales world on fire, the company still finds a way and seems to return with a vengeance in the next cycle. Whether that's real or just good optics it has kept the company's investors happy.

That level of ingenuity and at times illusion will be put to the test in 2022 like never before.

First as always, some background.

2021 was a roller coaster for Apple, largely due to a 2020 lawsuit brought on by Epic Games that was working its way through the system. I've gone in [depth](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4454721-apples-battle-with-epic-games-and-fortnite-yields-interesting-result?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) into that prior, but to topline - Epic sued Apple over being excluded from its app store.

Of course, what Epic likes to leave out of the story is that it provoked Apple into excluding it by directly violating the rules it had agreed to in the first place. It's very basis for the suit was a warped version of the ends justify the means.

In other words, yes we broke the rules, but we did it to prove a point and we shouldn't be held accountable as a result.

That's not quite how it works.

In court, a judge agreed and sided with Apple on nearly every single accusation - except one.

The judge said while Apple is not a monopoly it was engaging in [anticompetitive activities](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/epic-apple-antitrust-ruling-1235011223/) which set off a ton of confusion in the market. Reporters and analysts were falling over themselves to say ""Apple won"" or ""Apple lost"" which benefitted nobody, especially investors.

When a company like Apple has its market supremacy challenged on this level, the ramifications run deep and you can't use a one-word descriptor to fully capture the result.

So much so that media rushing out to post a click-baity headline (that's watered down in the actual piece) can be akin to yelling fire in a crowded room when there is no fire.

To be clear Apple didn't lose the court case, but it didn't entirely win either.

The one count the judge went against them on has the potential to be very costly, but it's also the one Apple expected to be challenged on and was already taking steps to counter. Its argument to the judge is the area she has concerns over- i.e. the so-called Apple [tax](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/cma-mobile-ecosystem-market-study/), which gives the company a 30% [commission](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/10/1023834758/apple-app-store-epic-games-fortnite-verdict#:~:text=Markus%20Schreiber%2FAP-,Apple%20CEO%20Tim%20Cook%20at%20the%20World%20Economic,Davos%2C%20Switzerland%2C%20in%202020.&text=A%20federal%20judge%20ordered%20Apple,30%25%20commission%20on%20app%20purchases.) off earnings - is being adjusted and that was in the works before the verdict.

Of course, what Apple likes to leave out of the story is that it was only doing this because of a [settlement](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering) with another lawsuit being brought against it by another group of developers. The difference is these plaintiffs honored the contract they had signed and were still honoring it while challenging it in the courts.

In the eyes of the court and public opinion that is very impactful.

The catch here for investors though is that in terms of 2021 financials this really meant nothing because nothing was going to change in the short run. With appeals, we weren't going to see any type of resolution until 2022 at the earliest - which takes us too now.

Apple has kicked this can down the road as far as it possibly can and while it's not at the end, the drop-off is in view. 2022 is set to be a year where Apple's model could see significant changes. Even if it convinces this judge that her ruling should be stayed because of their prior work, they have a much [tougher](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-10-10/government-big-tech-online-rights) road ahead with Congress.

Epic's goal in this lawsuit wasn't just to get its content back onto the app store, it looked like more to strike a blow to Apple that the government could in turn use to get involved. The judge in the case was smart enough to understand that and didn't give Epic what it wanted and went out of her way to make the [statement](https://www.vox.com/recode/22821277/apple-iphone-antitrust-app-store-privacy) that ""success is not illegal.""

Those four words are key here.

But let's play this out - let's say the judge doesn't buy Apple's argument and let's say Congress does get involved and forces some type of change. Where does that leave Apple?

The answer is not scary as it sounds.

Say what you want about Apple and its team but you have to give them credit. They are very good about forecasting the future and creating a vision for it that suits them. Remember this a company that basically decided it was done with the concept of a headphone jack and forced the rest of the world to be done with it as well.

Again - it got rid of a feature that has been around forever just because it could make more money by doing so.

Apple does what it wants and when it hits a wall it either goes over, under or through it.

Yes, it's a lot of money and yes that's something that can and should be of concern to investors, but this isn't a company that's just going to admit defeat and go gently into that good night.

Apple will fight until the last appeal to keep its current model in place or replace it with one that equally benefits them‚Ä¶ but what seems to escape critics is the idea that Apple is very capable of multitasking. This is not going to take up all of Apple's time, energy or resources‚Ä¶the company is already onto the next big thing and 2022 is reportedly the year we'll see that come to fruition.

That combined with its legal battles is what investors need to focus on because the two are connected.

Part of what makes Tim Cook a savvy leader is he understood being reliant on one product is not realistic to sustain a company of its size‚Ä¶ so he expanded. Under Cook's tenure we've seen Apple Music, Apple Fitness, Apple News, Apple TV+ and all of these bundled together in Apple One.

The key here is that each is a subscription service, piping millions of dollars into the Apple ecosystem each month.

And then there's Apple Watch, Apple TV and Apple AirPods which join the iPhone as hardware money-makers - all of which are updated regularly.

And that leads into Apple View which again pairs both sides of the business.

Apple View is the [rumored](https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/kuo-apple-ar-vr-headset/) name of Apple's next big hardware initiative tied to VR/AR.

This is not just a port of a previous product, projected to be released in 2022, this will be the company's long-awaited entry into the world of hyper-reality. Whether it's virtual or augmented content the introduction of some type of new [headwear](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-vr-and-ar-headset-rumors/) is on the way.

We don't know a lot about it, but we do know it is the biggest business expansion Apple has made in a while - and it is coming in the midst of sea change in the industry.

We also know it is only step one and it will likely be costly.

Reports are Apple View will be priced upwards of $1,000 to start and be pegged squarely to the early adopters that have always fueled Apple's initial success. The idea being [future](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/) versions will go down in price and eventually morph into some type of clear glasses verses enclosed goggles.

Of course, the hardware is only one component and software will be equally important as a way to keep consumers spending more and more money. So yes, taking a hit on the Apple tax will hurt, but it's not like Apple doesn't have additional ways to further expand its earnings.

You also have to keep in mind that even if Apple is forced to open the door for consumers to purchase content in a way that doesn't benefit Apple, there is no guarantee customers will walk through it.

Remember Apple's deceptively simplistic nature has always been a benefit - it will be on the app makers to convince users to use a roundabout method to pay for content. The lion's share of customers are not going to buy directly from another website verses the app store just to make a point to Apple.

Yes, some well, but the majority won't even realize that's an option.

Apple has always found a way to survive and thrive by mixing and matching its resources to maximize revenue. 2022 will likely make things a little more challenging for the company, but this isn't exactly a company that shies away from a challenge.","Why Apple's 2022 Could Be A Year Like No Other * 2021 was a roller coaster for Apple in surprising ways, largely due to a lawsuit brought on by Epic Games.

* With inflation running its hottest course in 40 years, the Federal Reserve has decided to accelerate the stimulus tapering schedule and prepare for raising interest rates as early as March.
* While rate hikes have historically deterred investors from growth stocks due to concerns over eroding valuation prospects, the Apple stock has remained largely resilient.

As one of the world‚Äôs best performing stocks, Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) has gained close to 40% this year. The stock, which last peaked at $182.13 not too long ago, is currently less than 7% from being the first U.S. publicly listed company to reach a $3 trillion market value and single-handedly accounts for about 15% of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100‚Äôs performance. Apple‚Äôs market value has grown by [more than 220x](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/apple-bulldozes-its-way-towards-3-trillion-value-tech-watch) since the late 1990s, buoyed by the company‚Äôs continuous ability to capture robust demand for its innovative portfolio of products and services.

And Apple‚Äôs strong fundamentals are expected to help the stock defy adverse impacts from the imminent rate hikes beginning next year. With inflation running at its hottest in almost four decades, the Federal Reserve decided Wednesday that it will increase the pace at which it is dialing back on the $120 billion monthly bond repurchasing program from $15 billion per month, which began in November, to [$30 billion per month](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/fed-doubles-taper-signals-three-2022-hikes-in-inflation-pivot?srnd=premium-asia). This would effectively conclude the stimulus program, put in place at the onset of the pandemic, coming March, rather than in [July as initially planned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/fed-to-start-tapering-asset-buys-by-15-billion-later-this-month). Rate hikes are expected to begin soon after to counter rising price pressures, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell affirming that the process will only begin after tapering ends and at a gradual pace. The latest dot plot indicates potential for the Federal Fund Rate to lift-off from near-zero beginning early 2022 with three quarter-point increases, plus another three in 2023 and two more in 2024. If materialized, the process would up the funds rate to 2.1% by 2024.

While rate hikes typically cause investors to turn risk averse due to concerns over [faster erosion of value on future gains](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-02/big-tech-s-stock-market-leadership-is-threatened-by-rising-rates) and stalled business growth due to rising costs of capital, especially for high-growth stocks, Apple gained close to 3% upon release of the Fed‚Äôs update on policy tightening. The stock closed at $179.30 on December 15th, nearing its peak of $182 on Monday. Apple‚Äôs rally, along with similar uptrends observed across other mega-cap tech stocks, accordingly drove intra-day gains of 2.4% for the Nasdaq 100 following the Federal Reserve‚Äôs update, indicating investors‚Äô preference to park their money in companies with robust growth prospects to counter risks from the impending rate increases.

With the coming holiday season a boon for Apple‚Äôs December-quarter sales, the stock‚Äôs valuation is expected to enter in the $3 trillion territory sooner than expected. Continued robust demand observed across Apple‚Äôs entire product line, generous share buy-backs, and additional revenue contributions expected within the foreseeable future resulting from new, cutting-edge products will also be key catalysts to support the company‚Äôs persistently strong fundamentals and keep the stock‚Äôs valuation above $3 trillion despite the impending rate hikes. Considering recent developments to the broader market and Apple‚Äôs growth prospects, we are raising our 12-month price target for the stock to $209.43.

## FY 2021 Overview and Recap of Fundamental Prospects

Fiscal 2021 was a big year for Apple. The company‚Äôs revenues for the year grew 33% from fiscal 2020 to $366 billion, despite on-and-off store closures resulting from recurring coronavirus outbreaks and supply chain constraints that have led to more than $9 billion in lost sales. Every product and service segment achieved record-setting revenues with more than 20% growth from previous year results. Much of the year‚Äôs success were attributable to a series of new product launches and feature upgrades. The most notable of which included the 5G-enabled family of iPhone 12s and iPhone 13s, as well as the M1-powered MacBook Pro and iPad Pro.

#### Key Developments in Products

iPhone sales grew by 39% this year, the most amongst other segments, and drove more than half of Apple‚Äôs fiscal 2021 revenues. The results were a stark contrast to last year‚Äôs slump in demand for the mobile device when consumers braced for pandemic-driven economic uncertainties. iPhone sales are expected to remain robust in coming years as global 5G device upgrades continue to gather pace. The likely launch of a more affordable 5G-enabled iPhone SE in 2022 is also expected to further Apple‚Äôs market share gains by [attracting switchers](https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/13/apples-most-affordable-5g-iphone-could-turn-a-billion-android-users-into-switchers/) from ‚Äúmore than a billion non-premium Android users‚Äù, and drive the active installed base to another all-time high. The anticipated momentum is further corroborated by iPhone sales patterns observed in recent quarters following the launch of 5G-enabled iPhone 12s and iPhone 13s, where the number of upgraders and switchers grew by [strong double digits](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4441901-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link). Apple‚Äôs strong ties with cell-phone carriers is also expected to drive meaningful iPhone sales contributions in coming years. Reputable wireless carriers in the U.S. like [Verizon](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-21/verizon-tops-subscriber-estimates-on-promotions-raises-outlook?srnd=technology-vp) and [AT&T](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-22/at-t-tops-earnings-estimates-on-surging-subscriber-growth?srnd=technology-vp) have already been keen on promoting the sale of 5G-enabled devices like the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 to encourage migration to the 5G network that they have spent billions of dollars on building across the nation. Telecom companies around the world are expected to spend [more than $700 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/telcos-seek-killer-app-to-recoup-billions-spent-on-5g-networks) over the next five years on building-out the 5G network, underscoring significant additional growth opportunities ahead for the iPhone segment as carriers push for the strongest multiyear upgrade cycle in a decade to recoup their investments.

Mac and iPad sales also grew significantly in fiscal 2021, reaching record revenues of $35.2 billion and $31.9 billion, respectively. Following the introduction of the [all-new M1-powered iMac](https://www.apple.com/hk/en/newsroom/2021/04/imac-features-all-new-design-in-vibrant-colors-m1-chip-and-45k-retina-display/) earlier this year, Apple also unveiled the [reimagined M1-Pro / M1-Max powered MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/hk/en/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/) in October. The custom M1 processors made the newest MacBook ‚Äúbetter than any Intel-based device for nearly every productivity use case outside of gaming‚Äù. This accordingly drove incredible demand for the portable workstation from a diverse group of consumers, ranging from professional creators and photographers to corporate users and students. The company is estimated to have shipped [over 3.2 million units](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576452/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipments-apple/#:~:text=In%20the%20third%20quarter%20of,the%20third%20quarter%20of%202021.) of Mac products during the September quarter, which drove record-setting revenues for the segment, while boosting its rank in global PC sales to fourth place amongst other vendors. The introduction of M1-processors in Apple‚Äôs computing products also bolstered its position in capitalizing on the surge in global demand for PCs and multi-purpose tablets by allowing the company to build devices with innovative features that can be seamlessly integrated across its ecosystem of peripheral accessories and services to draw adjacent revenues. With accelerated adoption of hybrid work and study arrangements in the post-pandemic era, global demand for portable workstations like PCs and multi-purpose tablets are expected to remain elevated in coming years ‚Äì the sectors are expected to grow into a [$224.3 billion](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210623005540/en/Global-Personal-Computers-Market-Report-2021-to-2030---COVID-19-Impact-and-Recovery---ResearchAndMarkets.com) and [$600 billion](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tablet-market-global-industry-analysis-and-opportunity-assessment-2016---2026-300370887.html) market, respectively, by 2025, which makes favorable trends for Apple‚Äôs Mac and iPad segments.

Recent speculations on Apple‚Äôs intentions to [strengthen its in-house chip development capacity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/apple-builds-team-in-new-office-to-bring-wireless-chips-in-house) will likely further the advancement of its technologies offered in coming years and draw additional demand to its products. The company is currently looking for engineers to build-out its capacity in the development of ‚Äúwireless radios, radio-frequency integrated circuits, and a wireless system-on-chip (‚ÄúSoC‚Äù)‚Äù, as well as ‚Äúsemiconductors for connecting Bluetooth and Wi-Fi‚Äù. These developments are expected to further enhance seamless integration across Apple‚Äôs devices and increase stickiness to its ecosystem of product and service offerings, making its chip unit one of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúmost prized assets‚Äù.

#### Key Developments in Services

On the services front, a strong subscriber base had enabled the segment to hit record-setting revenues of more than $68.4 billion in fiscal 2021, up 27% from the prior year. To date, Apple has garnered more than 745 million paid subscribers across its high-margin service offerings, representing a five-fold increase over the last five years. Apple‚Äôs increasing push for a subscription-based business model across its wide variety of service platforms, ranging from Apple Music to iCloud storage solutions, paired with attractive new offerings that address key consumer trends in recent years have been a key driver to the company‚Äôs fast-expanding margins. New exciting add-on features introduced for existing service platforms include [Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio](https://www.apple.com/hk/en/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/) for Apple Music and the [Apple Music Voice Plan](https://www.apple.com/hk/en/newsroom/2021/10/apple-introduces-the-apple-music-voice-plan/). The new subscription-based offerings are expected to further Apple‚Äôs reach to adjacent opportunities stemming from increasing global usage of smartphones, laptops and other advanced home electronic products ‚Äì for instance, the global music streaming market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 16% towards a [projected value of $61 billion](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156338/0/en/Global-Music-Streaming-Market-2020-to-2026-by-Content-Type-Platform-Service-Type-End-user-and-Region.html) over the next five years, underscoring significant growth headroom for Apple Music. And Apple‚Äôs latest introduction of the [Apple One bundle](https://www.apple.com/apple-one/) is expected to be a key contributor to furthering service segment sales in coming years by attracting new users to pay for subscription services that they otherwise would not have had it not been for the bundle discounts.

Continued growth in market demand for mobile applications will also be a boon to Apple‚Äôs fast-growing services segment. The global market for mobile applications is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18.4% and reach a market value of [more than $400 billion](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mobile-application-market#:~:text=The%20global%20mobile%20application%20market,18.4%25%20from%202019%20to%202026.) over the next five years. With AAPL hosting [one of the largest and most used app stores](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/) in the world, it would be reasonable to assume that related revenues would grow at a similar pace. Despite [mounting global regulatory scrutiny](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4454689-apple-key-takeaways-on-impending-app-store-policy-changes?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) over Apple‚Äôs alleged antitrust violations with its App Store ‚Äì the most notable of which stemming from an ongoing [legal battle with Epic Games](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-16/apple-must-be-stopped-and-google-s-crazy-epic-games-ceo-says) ‚Äì the company‚Äôs continued focus on ensuring user privacy, security, and ease of transactions might have saved the day. According to a survey of 4,000 Apple product users performed by Morgan Stanley across the U.S. and China, most have indicated loyalty to Apple‚Äôs App store due to the ‚Äúvalue of security, privacy and ease of transactions‚Äù provided, despite developers pushing for rights to transact outside of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. Apple‚Äôs recent success in [delaying App Store changes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/apple-wins-reprieve-in-court-deadline-to-revamp-app-store-rules) ordered by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in [September](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-s-app-store-dealt-blow-by-judge-in-epic-antitrust-case?srnd=technology-vp) as part of a year-long lawsuit brought against by Epic Games is another sign of the App Store‚Äôs continued strength. The company has argued that the court-mandated order to allow App Store users to ‚Äúbuy directly from developers on the web‚Äù would be a threat to the security of their privacy.

Currently, developers are fighting for their rights to have app users transact outside of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem, which charges developers a hefty commission fee of up to 30% on all purchases. As Apple continues with its appeal of the ruling, the ultimate court decision on whether App Store changes would need to be implemented could take at least another year. But even with an unfavorable ruling, where Apple would have to allow developers to redirect users to payments outside of its ecosystem and/or lower its in-app purchase commission rate, App Store revenues are only expected to decrease by [at most $4 billion per year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/apple-wins-reprieve-in-court-deadline-to-revamp-app-store-rules) which will not place a material impact on its valuation prospects. The actual quantified impact might even be less than what the market has forecasted, considering the value that App Store users have ascribed to the level of security and convenience that Apple has offered through the platform.

## Key Catalysts Ahead

Apple is undoubtedly a key gateway to bringing emerging technologies to the mainstream due to its massive installed base of devices and related service platform users. And because of this, the highly anticipated launch of cutting-edge products like AR/VR headsets and autonomous vehicles in coming years will likely catapult the stock to new heights. The pioneer of disruptive consumer electronics and devices is expected to launch a [VR headset and AR glasses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses?sref=9hGJlFio) by early 2023, a nascent technology that has been picking up steam in recent months with increasing talks of the metaverse. Similar to most VR headsets already available in the market, Apple‚Äôs will feature a 3D display to enable an immersive environment for a variety of activities from gaming to communicating. The differentiating factor will be the company‚Äôs plans to implement best-in-class graphics chips in the device to facilitate ultra-high-resolution displays. The impending VR headset will ultimately lay the foundation for its AR glasses, which Apple expects to be the ‚Äú[larger opportunity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses?sref=9hGJlFio)‚Äù.

Over the next five years, opportunities pertaining to the metaverse are expected to blossom into an [$800 billion market](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/metaverse-may-be-800-billion-market-next-tech-platform/). Related software and service sales are expected to drive more than 70% of the projected addressable market, while the remainder will likely be driven by hardware sales. This makes strong tailwinds for Apple, which does not only stand to capitalize on growing metaverse opportunities through the sale of its impending AR/VR headset, but also adjacent revenues pertaining to the usage of related apps, software and service platforms.

Speculations on Apple‚Äôs ongoing development of [a self-driving electric car](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle?sref=9hGJlFio) is also expected to materialize into meaningful upsides for the stock within the foreseeable future. The company is now planning to launch the new product category by 2025, at which time the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach a value of [more than $200 billion](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-global-autonomous-vehicle-market-2025-a-200-billion-opportunity-assessment---long-haul-trucking-market-will-grow-at-60-cagr-through-2025-301024974.html). The eventual car will likely feature homages to its existing product portfolio, like an ‚ÄúiPad-like touch screen‚Äù infotainment system. And on the technology front, Apple is believed to have completed the development of a custom silicon for powering the vehicle‚Äôs autonomous driving capabilities. The newest chips will soon be implemented into its existing fleet of retrofitted SUVs for testing in California according to the state‚Äôs DMV, a sign that the impending launch is near.

While Apple‚Äôs current market value may already be reflective of ‚Äúconsistent material revenue contributions from new products and services over time‚Äù, additional upsides from the above-mentioned new product category launches are still missing. But this will likely change within the next 12 months as the impending launch of an Apple AR/VR device draws near. Near-term projections on early AR/VR device sales are expected to boost Apple‚Äôs valuation by [at least $150 billion](https://www.thestreet.com/apple/news/apple-stock-how-much-will-the-metaverse-move-the-needle). And over time when metaverse trends continue to gain mainstream traction, Apple is expected to generate more than $200 billion in annual revenues from the AR/VR segment, which could add another 15% on top of its current market value.

## Valuation Prospects and Potential Impacts from the Impending Rate Increases

Adjusting our most recent forecast for Apple‚Äôs fiscal 2021 year-end results and December-quarter guidance, our base case projection estimates total net sales of $439.3 billion by the end of fiscal 2022, with further growth towards $668.5 billion by fiscal 2026. The growth assumptions applied across segment revenues in our forecast remains largely unchanged from our [most recent analysis](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4444713-apple-stock-buy-sell-recent-earnings?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) on the stock, with additional consideration for management‚Äôs near-term outlook on supply constraint impacts and the impending rate hikes. Specifically, lost revenues of $9 billion (i.e. approximately $3 billion during June-quarter and $6 billion during September-quarter) attributable to industry-wide chip shortages and pandemic-driven manufacturing delays during the second half of fiscal 2021 is expected to worsen into the first half of fiscal 2022. While there have been observed improvements to supply chain challenges, continuously robust demand for Apple products is what will drive a higher volume of lost sales in coming quarters. Nonetheless, Apple remains well-positioned for strong fundamentals ahead, which will help to alleviate some of investors‚Äô concerns on valuation due to impending rate hikes.

Drawing on the above considerations, our 12-month price target for the Apple stock has been revised to $209.43. This represents upside potential of more than 22% based on the last traded price of $171.14 on December 17th.

üì∑

Source: Author, with data from our internal valuation analysis.

The revised price target is derived using a discounted cash flow (‚ÄúDCF‚Äù) analysis over a ten-year discrete period in conjunction with the financial projections updated for Apple‚Äôs recent developments as analyzed in earlier sections. Similar to our original valuation analysis, we have applied a WACC of 8% to discount Apple‚Äôs projected free cash flows. The discount function is reflective of the company‚Äôs risk profile, taking into consideration its current capital structure and strong balance sheet. Apple‚Äôs cost of capital for growth is not expected to change significantly as a result of the impending rate hikes, considering a large portion of its existing debt are fixed-rate notes. The company also boasts a consistently robust net cash position, in which management intends to deploy towards additional growth without having to incur incremental capital costs ahead of interest rate increases. This is expected to further cement investors‚Äô confidence in the Apple stock, as they continue their ‚Äúflight to quality‚Äù amidst fear of broader market pressure from rising interest rates.

The valuation analysis also assumes an exit multiple of 19.8x, which is consistent with current market expectations on Apple‚Äôs growth trajectory over the forecasted period. The applied exit multiple assumption could even improve further within the next 12 months, considering the impending launch of new product segments like AR/VR devices and autonomous vehicles, and offset any potential impacts from the upcoming increases to interest rates.

## Conclusion

Based on the foregoing analysis, the anticipated addition of 175 to 200 basis points to the current near-zero Federal Fund Rate over the next two years is not expected to cause material adverse impacts to Apple‚Äôs performance from both a fundamental and valuation perspective. Robust global demand for Apple products and services, paired with new innovations are expected to further bolster the company‚Äôs fundamental growth prospects. This would accordingly bring additional improvements to Apple‚Äôs balance sheet, and further strengthen its position against downward valuation pressures from broader macro headwinds. In fact, increasing demand for quality growth stocks to counter risks resulting from the impending rate hikes might even fuel Apple‚Äôs valuation growth momentum. On these considerations, Apple remains one of the best-performing tech stocks to own given its robust uptrend to $3 trillion in the near-term despite impending rate hikes.","Apple Stock: The Strongest Shield Against Rate Hikes [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4475887-apple-stock-aapl-strongest-shield-against-rate-hikes](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4475887-apple-stock-aapl-strongest-shield-against-rate-hikes)

As one of the world‚Äôs best performing stocks, Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) has gained close to 40% this year. The stock, which last peaked at $182.13 not too long ago, is currently less than 7% from being the first U.S. publicly listed company to reach a $3 trillion market value and single-handedly accounts for about 15% of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100‚Äôs performance. Apple‚Äôs market value has grown by [more than 220x](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/apple-bulldozes-its-way-towards-3-trillion-value-tech-watch) since the late 1990s, buoyed by the company‚Äôs continuous ability to capture robust demand for its innovative portfolio of products and services.

And Apple‚Äôs strong fundamentals are expected to help the stock defy adverse impacts from the imminent rate hikes beginning next year. With inflation running at its hottest in almost four decades, the Federal Reserve decided Wednesday that it will increase the pace at which it is dialing back on the $120 billion monthly bond repurchasing program from $15 billion per month, which began in November, to [$30 billion per month](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/fed-doubles-taper-signals-three-2022-hikes-in-inflation-pivot?srnd=premium-asia). This would effectively conclude the stimulus program, put in place at the onset of the pandemic, coming March, rather than in [July as initially planned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/fed-to-start-tapering-asset-buys-by-15-billion-later-this-month). Rate hikes are expected to begin soon after to counter rising price pressures, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell affirming that the process will only begin after tapering ends and at a gradual pace. The latest dot plot indicates potential for the Federal Fund Rate to lift-off from near-zero beginning early 2022 with three quarter-point increases, plus another three in 2023 and two more in 2024. If materialized, the process would up the funds rate to 2.1% by 2024.

While rate hikes typically cause investors to turn risk averse due to concerns over [faster erosion of value on future gains](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-02/big-tech-s-stock-market-leadership-is-threatened-by-rising-rates) and stalled business growth due to rising costs of capital, especially for high-growth stocks, Apple gained close to 3% upon release of the Fed‚Äôs update on policy tightening. The stock closed at $179.30 on December 15th, nearing its peak of $182 on Monday. Apple‚Äôs rally, along with similar uptrends observed across other mega-cap tech stocks, accordingly drove intra-day gains of 2.4% for the Nasdaq 100 following the Federal Reserve‚Äôs update, indicating investors‚Äô preference to park their money in companies with robust growth prospects to counter risks from the impending rate increases.

With the coming holiday season a boon for Apple‚Äôs December-quarter sales, the stock‚Äôs valuation is expected to enter in the $3 trillion territory sooner than expected. Continued robust demand observed across Apple‚Äôs entire product line, generous share buy-backs, and additional revenue contributions expected within the foreseeable future resulting from new, cutting-edge products will also be key catalysts to support the company‚Äôs persistently strong fundamentals and keep the stock‚Äôs valuation above $3 trillion despite the impending rate hikes. Considering recent developments to the broader market and Apple‚Äôs growth prospects, we are raising our 12-month price target for the stock to $209.43.

## FY 2021 Overview and Recap of Fundamental Prospects

Fiscal 2021 was a big year for Apple. The company‚Äôs revenues for the year grew 33% from fiscal 2020 to $366 billion, despite on-and-off store closures resulting from recurring coronavirus outbreaks and supply chain constraints that have led to more than $9 billion in lost sales. Every product and service segment achieved record-setting revenues with more than 20% growth from previous year results. Much of the year‚Äôs success were attributable to a series of new product launches and feature upgrades. The most notable of which included the 5G-enabled family of iPhone 12s and iPhone 13s, as well as the M1-powered MacBook Pro and iPad Pro.

#### Key Developments in Products

iPhone sales grew by 39% this year, the most amongst other segments, and drove more than half of Apple‚Äôs fiscal 2021 revenues. The results were a stark contrast to last year‚Äôs slump in demand for the mobile device when consumers braced for pandemic-driven economic uncertainties. iPhone sales are expected to remain robust in coming years as global 5G device upgrades continue to gather pace. The likely launch of a more affordable 5G-enabled iPhone SE in 2022 is also expected to further Apple‚Äôs market share gains by [attracting switchers](https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/13/apples-most-affordable-5g-iphone-could-turn-a-billion-android-users-into-switchers/) from ‚Äúmore than a billion non-premium Android users‚Äù, and drive the active installed base to another all-time high. The anticipated momentum is further corroborated by iPhone sales patterns observed in recent quarters following the launch of 5G-enabled iPhone 12s and iPhone 13s, where the number of upgraders and switchers grew by [strong double digits](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4441901-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link). Apple‚Äôs strong ties with cell-phone carriers is also expected to drive meaningful iPhone sales contributions in coming years. Reputable wireless carriers in the U.S. like [Verizon](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-21/verizon-tops-subscriber-estimates-on-promotions-raises-outlook?srnd=technology-vp) and [AT&T](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-22/at-t-tops-earnings-estimates-on-surging-subscriber-growth?srnd=technology-vp) have already been keen on promoting the sale of 5G-enabled devices like the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 to encourage migration to the 5G network that they have spent billions of dollars on building across the nation. Telecom companies around the world are expected to spend [more than $700 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/telcos-seek-killer-app-to-recoup-billions-spent-on-5g-networks) over the next five years on building-out the 5G network, underscoring significant additional growth opportunities ahead for the iPhone segment as carriers push for the strongest multiyear upgrade cycle in a decade to recoup their investments.

Mac and iPad sales also grew significantly in fiscal 2021, reaching record revenues of $35.2 billion and $31.9 billion, respectively. Following the introduction of the [all-new M1-powered iMac](https://www.apple.com/hk/en/newsroom/2021/04/imac-features-all-new-design-in-vibrant-colors-m1-chip-and-45k-retina-display/) earlier this year, Apple also unveiled the [reimagined M1-Pro / M1-Max powered MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/hk/en/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/) in October. The custom M1 processors made the newest MacBook ‚Äúbetter than any Intel-based device for nearly every productivity use case outside of gaming‚Äù. This accordingly drove incredible demand for the portable workstation from a diverse group of consumers, ranging from professional creators and photographers to corporate users and students. The company is estimated to have shipped [over 3.2 million units](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576452/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipments-apple/#:~:text=In%20the%20third%20quarter%20of,the%20third%20quarter%20of%202021.) of Mac products during the September quarter, which drove record-setting revenues for the segment, while boosting its rank in global PC sales to fourth place amongst other vendors. The introduction of M1-processors in Apple‚Äôs computing products also bolstered its position in capitalizing on the surge in global demand for PCs and multi-purpose tablets by allowing the company to build devices with innovative features that can be seamlessly integrated across its ecosystem of peripheral accessories and services to draw adjacent revenues. With accelerated adoption of hybrid work and study arrangements in the post-pandemic era, global demand for portable workstations like PCs and multi-purpose tablets are expected to remain elevated in coming years ‚Äì the sectors are expected to grow into a [$224.3 billion](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210623005540/en/Global-Personal-Computers-Market-Report-2021-to-2030---COVID-19-Impact-and-Recovery---ResearchAndMarkets.com) and [$600 billion](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tablet-market-global-industry-analysis-and-opportunity-assessment-2016---2026-300370887.html) market, respectively, by 2025, which makes favorable trends for Apple‚Äôs Mac and iPad segments.

Recent speculations on Apple‚Äôs intentions to [strengthen its in-house chip development capacity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/apple-builds-team-in-new-office-to-bring-wireless-chips-in-house) will likely further the advancement of its technologies offered in coming years and draw additional demand to its products. The company is currently looking for engineers to build-out its capacity in the development of ‚Äúwireless radios, radio-frequency integrated circuits, and a wireless system-on-chip (‚ÄúSoC‚Äù)‚Äù, as well as ‚Äúsemiconductors for connecting Bluetooth and Wi-Fi‚Äù. These developments are expected to further enhance seamless integration across Apple‚Äôs devices and increase stickiness to its ecosystem of product and service offerings, making its chip unit one of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúmost prized assets‚Äù.

#### Key Developments in Services

On the services front, a strong subscriber base had enabled the segment to hit record-setting revenues of more than $68.4 billion in fiscal 2021, up 27% from the prior year. To date, Apple has garnered more than 745 million paid subscribers across its high-margin service offerings, representing a five-fold increase over the last five years. Apple‚Äôs increasing push for a subscription-based business model across its wide variety of service platforms, ranging from Apple Music to iCloud storage solutions, paired with attractive new offerings that address key consumer trends in recent years have been a key driver to the company‚Äôs fast-expanding margins. New exciting add-on features introduced for existing service platforms include [Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio](https://www.apple.com/hk/en/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/) for Apple Music and the [Apple Music Voice Plan](https://www.apple.com/hk/en/newsroom/2021/10/apple-introduces-the-apple-music-voice-plan/). The new subscription-based offerings are expected to further Apple‚Äôs reach to adjacent opportunities stemming from increasing global usage of smartphones, laptops and other advanced home electronic products ‚Äì for instance, the global music streaming market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 16% towards a [projected value of $61 billion](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156338/0/en/Global-Music-Streaming-Market-2020-to-2026-by-Content-Type-Platform-Service-Type-End-user-and-Region.html) over the next five years, underscoring significant growth headroom for Apple Music. And Apple‚Äôs latest introduction of the [Apple One bundle](https://www.apple.com/apple-one/) is expected to be a key contributor to furthering service segment sales in coming years by attracting new users to pay for subscription services that they otherwise would not have had it not been for the bundle discounts.

Continued growth in market demand for mobile applications will also be a boon to Apple‚Äôs fast-growing services segment. The global market for mobile applications is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18.4% and reach a market value of [more than $400 billion](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mobile-application-market#:~:text=The%20global%20mobile%20application%20market,18.4%25%20from%202019%20to%202026.) over the next five years. With AAPL hosting [one of the largest and most used app stores](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/) in the world, it would be reasonable to assume that related revenues would grow at a similar pace. Despite [mounting global regulatory scrutiny](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4454689-apple-key-takeaways-on-impending-app-store-policy-changes?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) over Apple‚Äôs alleged antitrust violations with its App Store ‚Äì the most notable of which stemming from an ongoing [legal battle with Epic Games](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-16/apple-must-be-stopped-and-google-s-crazy-epic-games-ceo-says) ‚Äì the company‚Äôs continued focus on ensuring user privacy, security, and ease of transactions might have saved the day. According to a survey of 4,000 Apple product users performed by Morgan Stanley across the U.S. and China, most have indicated loyalty to Apple‚Äôs App store due to the ‚Äúvalue of security, privacy and ease of transactions‚Äù provided, despite developers pushing for rights to transact outside of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. Apple‚Äôs recent success in [delaying App Store changes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/apple-wins-reprieve-in-court-deadline-to-revamp-app-store-rules) ordered by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in [September](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-s-app-store-dealt-blow-by-judge-in-epic-antitrust-case?srnd=technology-vp) as part of a year-long lawsuit brought against by Epic Games is another sign of the App Store‚Äôs continued strength. The company has argued that the court-mandated order to allow App Store users to ‚Äúbuy directly from developers on the web‚Äù would be a threat to the security of their privacy.

Currently, developers are fighting for their rights to have app users transact outside of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem, which charges developers a hefty commission fee of up to 30% on all purchases. As Apple continues with its appeal of the ruling, the ultimate court decision on whether App Store changes would need to be implemented could take at least another year. But even with an unfavorable ruling, where Apple would have to allow developers to redirect users to payments outside of its ecosystem and/or lower its in-app purchase commission rate, App Store revenues are only expected to decrease by [at most $4 billion per year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/apple-wins-reprieve-in-court-deadline-to-revamp-app-store-rules) which will not place a material impact on its valuation prospects. The actual quantified impact might even be less than what the market has forecasted, considering the value that App Store users have ascribed to the level of security and convenience that Apple has offered through the platform.

## Key Catalysts Ahead

Apple is undoubtedly a key gateway to bringing emerging technologies to the mainstream due to its massive installed base of devices and related service platform users. And because of this, the highly anticipated launch of cutting-edge products like AR/VR headsets and autonomous vehicles in coming years will likely catapult the stock to new heights. The pioneer of disruptive consumer electronics and devices is expected to launch a [VR headset and AR glasses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses?sref=9hGJlFio) by early 2023, a nascent technology that has been picking up steam in recent months with increasing talks of the metaverse. Similar to most VR headsets already available in the market, Apple‚Äôs will feature a 3D display to enable an immersive environment for a variety of activities from gaming to communicating. The differentiating factor will be the company‚Äôs plans to implement best-in-class graphics chips in the device to facilitate ultra-high-resolution displays. The impending VR headset will ultimately lay the foundation for its AR glasses, which Apple expects to be the ‚Äú[larger opportunity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses?sref=9hGJlFio)‚Äù.

Over the next five years, opportunities pertaining to the metaverse are expected to blossom into an [$800 billion market](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/metaverse-may-be-800-billion-market-next-tech-platform/). Related software and service sales are expected to drive more than 70% of the projected addressable market, while the remainder will likely be driven by hardware sales. This makes strong tailwinds for Apple, which does not only stand to capitalize on growing metaverse opportunities through the sale of its impending AR/VR headset, but also adjacent revenues pertaining to the usage of related apps, software and service platforms.

Speculations on Apple‚Äôs ongoing development of [a self-driving electric car](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle?sref=9hGJlFio) is also expected to materialize into meaningful upsides for the stock within the foreseeable future. The company is now planning to launch the new product category by 2025, at which time the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach a value of [more than $200 billion](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-global-autonomous-vehicle-market-2025-a-200-billion-opportunity-assessment---long-haul-trucking-market-will-grow-at-60-cagr-through-2025-301024974.html). The eventual car will likely feature homages to its existing product portfolio, like an ‚ÄúiPad-like touch screen‚Äù infotainment system. And on the technology front, Apple is believed to have completed the development of a custom silicon for powering the vehicle‚Äôs autonomous driving capabilities. The newest chips will soon be implemented into its existing fleet of retrofitted SUVs for testing in California according to the state‚Äôs DMV, a sign that the impending launch is near.

While Apple‚Äôs current market value may already be reflective of ‚Äúconsistent material revenue contributions from new products and services over time‚Äù, additional upsides from the above-mentioned new product category launches are still missing. But this will likely change within the next 12 months as the impending launch of an Apple AR/VR device draws near. Near-term projections on early AR/VR device sales are expected to boost Apple‚Äôs valuation by [at least $150 billion](https://www.thestreet.com/apple/news/apple-stock-how-much-will-the-metaverse-move-the-needle). And over time when metaverse trends continue to gain mainstream traction, Apple is expected to generate more than $200 billion in annual revenues from the AR/VR segment, which could add another 15% on top of its current market value.

## Valuation Prospects and Potential Impacts from the Impending Rate Increases

Adjusting our most recent forecast for Apple‚Äôs fiscal 2021 year-end results and December-quarter guidance, our base case projection estimates total net sales of $439.3 billion by the end of fiscal 2022, with further growth towards $668.5 billion by fiscal 2026. The growth assumptions applied across segment revenues in our forecast remains largely unchanged from our [most recent analysis](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4444713-apple-stock-buy-sell-recent-earnings?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) on the stock, with additional consideration for management‚Äôs near-term outlook on supply constraint impacts and the impending rate hikes. Specifically, lost revenues of $9 billion (i.e. approximately $3 billion during June-quarter and $6 billion during September-quarter) attributable to industry-wide chip shortages and pandemic-driven manufacturing delays during the second half of fiscal 2021 is expected to worsen into the first half of fiscal 2022. While there have been observed improvements to supply chain challenges, continuously robust demand for Apple products is what will drive a higher volume of lost sales in coming quarters. Nonetheless, Apple remains well-positioned for strong fundamentals ahead, which will help to alleviate some of investors‚Äô concerns on valuation due to impending rate hikes.

Drawing on the above considerations, our 12-month price target for the Apple stock has been revised to $209.43. This represents upside potential of more than 22% based on the last traded price of $171.14 on December 17th.

üì∑

Source: Author, with data from our internal valuation analysis.

The revised price target is derived using a discounted cash flow (‚ÄúDCF‚Äù) analysis over a ten-year discrete period in conjunction with the financial projections updated for Apple‚Äôs recent developments as analyzed in earlier sections. Similar to our original valuation analysis, we have applied a WACC of 8% to discount Apple‚Äôs projected free cash flows. The discount function is reflective of the company‚Äôs risk profile, taking into consideration its current capital structure and strong balance sheet. Apple‚Äôs cost of capital for growth is not expected to change significantly as a result of the impending rate hikes, considering a large portion of its existing debt are fixed-rate notes. The company also boasts a consistently robust net cash position, in which management intends to deploy towards additional growth without having to incur incremental capital costs ahead of interest rate increases. This is expected to further cement investors‚Äô confidence in the Apple stock, as they continue their ‚Äúflight to quality‚Äù amidst fear of broader market pressure from rising interest rates.

The valuation analysis also assumes an exit multiple of 19.8x, which is consistent with current market expectations on Apple‚Äôs growth trajectory over the forecasted period. The applied exit multiple assumption could even improve further within the next 12 months, considering the impending launch of new product segments like AR/VR devices and autonomous vehicles, and offset any potential impacts from the upcoming increases to interest rates.

## Conclusion

Based on the foregoing analysis, the anticipated addition of 175 to 200 basis points to the current near-zero Federal Fund Rate over the next two years is not expected to cause material adverse impacts to Apple‚Äôs performance from both a fundamental and valuation perspective. Robust global demand for Apple products and services, paired with new innovations are expected to further bolster the company‚Äôs fundamental growth prospects. This would accordingly bring additional improvements to Apple‚Äôs balance sheet, and further strengthen its position against downward valuation pressures from broader macro headwinds. In fact, increasing demand for quality growth stocks to counter risks resulting from the impending rate hikes might even fuel Apple‚Äôs valuation growth momentum. On these considerations, Apple remains one of the best-performing tech stocks to own given its robust uptrend to $3 trillion in the near-term despite impending rate hikes.",,0.000900606,3971,1163,AAPL

2021 11 16 AAPL must be stopped and GOOGL s crazy epic games ceo says the companys continued focus on ensuring user privacy security and ease of transactions might have saved the day According to a survey of 4 000 AAPL product users performed by Morgan Stanley across the U S and China most have indicated loyalty to Apples App store due to the value of security privacy and ease of transactions provided despite developers pushing for rights to transact outside of Apples ecosystem Apples recent success in delaying App Store changes https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 12 08 AAPL wins

users transact outside of Apples ecosystem which charges developers a hefty commission fee of up to 30 on all purchases As AAPL continues with its appeal of the ruling the ultimate court decision on whether App Store changes would need to be implemented could take at least another year But even with an unfavorable ruling where AAPL would have to allow developers to redirect users to payments outside of its ecosystem and or lower its in app purchase commission rate App Store revenues are only expected to decrease by at most 4 billion per year https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 12

has forecasted considering the value that App Store users have ascribed to the level of security and convenience that AAPL has offered through the platform Key Catalysts Ahead AAPL is undoubtedly a key gateway to bringing emerging technologies to the mainstream due to its massive installed base of devices and related service platform users And because of this the highly anticipated launch of cutting edge products like AR VR headsets and autonomous vehicles in coming years will likely catapult the stock to new heights The pioneer of disruptive consumer electronics and devices is expected to launch a VR headset and AR glasses https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 01 21 AAPL s first vr headset to be niche precursor to eventual ar glasses sref 9hGJlFio by early 2023 a nascent technology that has been picking up steam in recent months with increasing talks of the metaverse Similar to most VR headsets already available in the market Apples will feature a 3D display to enable an immersive environment for a variety of activities from gaming to communicating The differentiating factor will be the companys plans to implement best in class graphics chips in the device to facilitate ultra high resolution displays The impending VR headset will ultimately lay the foundation for its AR glasses which AAPL expects to be the larger opportunity https www bloomberg com news

an 800 billion market https www bloomberg com professional blog metaverse may be 800 billion market next tech platform Related software and service sales are expected to drive more than 70 of the projected addressable market while the remainder will likely be driven by hardware sales This makes strong tailwinds for AAPL which does not only stand to capitalize on growing metaverse opportunities through the sale of its impending AR VR headset but also adjacent revenues pertaining to the usage of related apps software and service platforms Speculations on Apples ongoing development of a self driving electric car https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 11 18 AAPL accelerates work on car aims for fully autonomous vehicle sref 9hGJlFio is also expected to materialize into meaningful

believed to have completed the development of a custom silicon for powering the vehicles autonomous driving capabilities The newest chips will soon be implemented into its existing fleet of retrofitted SUVs for testing in California according to the states DMV a sign that the impending launch is near While Apples current market value may already be reflective of consistent material revenue contributions from new products and services over time additional upsides from the above mentioned new product category launches are still missing But this will likely change within the next 12 months as the impending launch of an AAPL AR VR device draws near Near term projections on early AR VR device sales are expected to boost Apples valuation by at least 150 billion https www

billion in annual revenues from the AR VR segment which could add another 15 on top of its current market value Valuation Prospects and Potential Impacts from the Impending Rate Increases Adjusting our most recent forecast for Apples fiscal 2021 year end results and December quarter guidance our base case projection estimates total net sales of 439 3 billion by the end of fiscal 2022 with further growth towards 668 5 billion by fiscal 2026 The growth assumptions applied across segment revenues in our forecast remains largely unchanged from our most recent analysis https seekingalpha

outlook on supply constraint impacts and the impending rate hikes Specifically lost revenues of 9 billion i e approximately 3 billion during June quarter and 6 billion during September quarter attributable to industry wide chip shortages and pandemic driven manufacturing delays during the second half of fiscal 2021 is expected to worsen into the first half of fiscal 2022 While there have been observed improvements to supply chain challenges continuously robust demand for AAPL products is what will drive a higher volume of lost sales in coming quarters Nonetheless AAPL remains well positioned for strong fundamentals ahead which will help to alleviate some of investors concerns on valuation due to impending rate hikes i Base Case Financial Projections Source Author with data from

material growth assumptions applied Drawing on the above considerations our 12 month price target for the AAPL stock has been revised to 209 43 This represents upside potential of more than 22 based on the last traded price of 171 14 on December 17th Source Author with data from our internal valuation analysis The revised price target is derived using a discounted cash flow DCF analysis over a ten year discrete period in conjunction with the financial projections updated for Apples recent developments as analyzed in earlier sections Similar to our original valuation analysis we have applied a WACC of 8 to discount Apples projected free cash flows The discount function is reflective of the companys risk profile taking into consideration its current capital structure and strong balance sheet Apples cost of capital for growth is not expected to change significantly as a result of the impending rate hikes considering a large portion of its existing debt are fixed rate notes The company also boasts a consistently robust net cash position in which management intends to deploy towards additional growth without having to incur incremental capital costs ahead of interest rate increases This is expected to further cement investors confidence in the AAPL stock as they continue their flight to quality amidst fear of broader market pressure from rising interest rates The valuation analysis also assumes an exit multiple of 19 8x which is consistent with current market expectations on Apples growth trajectory over the forecasted period The applied exit multiple assumption could even improve further within the next 12 months considering the impending launch of new product segments like AR VR devices and autonomous vehicles and offset any potential impacts from the upcoming increases to interest rates i Base Case Valuation Analysis ii Sensitivity Analysis Source Author with data from our internal valuation analysis Conclusion Based on the foregoing analysis the anticipated addition of 175 to 200 basis points to the current near zero Federal Fund Rate over the next two years is not expected to cause material adverse impacts to Apples performance from both a fundamental and valuation perspective Robust global demand for AAPL products and services paired with new innovations are expected to further bolster the companys fundamental growth prospects This would accordingly bring additional improvements to Apples balance sheet and further strengthen its position against downward valuation pressures from broader macro headwinds In fact increasing demand for quality growth stocks to counter risks resulting from the impending rate hikes might even fuel Apples valuation growth momentum On these considerations AAPL remains one of the best performing tech stocks to own given its robust uptrend to 3 trillion in the near term despite impending rate hikes,"AAPL,GOOGL,INTC,MSFT,NFLX","{""INTC"": {""finbert"": {""label"": ""Strongly

This video / analysis may or may not be liked here, but it will hopefully shed some light on what we have been seeing with aapl stock and potentially where it could be going.  Aapl stock has been in a 7 swing correction since the ATH's reached several months ago.  There is a chance that when the market pulls back aapl could get to 110 range before a ton of buyers step in.  I do believe that a back to tech rotation will happen after the next leg down, so there is light at the end of the tunnel.

If interested in my analysis please see video at link below.  I also do daily analysis on spy and qqq.

Note:  I am not a financial advisor and I do not short aapl stock.  I am long the stock but use wave theory to pick scalp and cut loss points.
